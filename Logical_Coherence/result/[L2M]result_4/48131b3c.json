So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 0], [0, 7]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 grid in the output grid. The 2x2 grid is a copy of the 2x2 grid centered on the corresponding cell in the input grid. If the cell is on the edge of the input grid, the 2x2 grid is obtained by reflecting the cells adjacent to the cell across the edge.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a larger version of the input grid, with each cell in the input grid expanded to a 2x2 square in the output grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, that's correct. Each cell in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 square in the output grid. The values in this 2x2 square are determined by the values of the cell in the input grid and its neighbors. If the cell is on the edge of the input grid, the values are determined by reflecting the cells adjacent to the cell across the edge.\n\nQ3: Apply the pattern to the quiz input to find the output.\nA3: If we apply the pattern to the quiz input, the output grid would be:\n[[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Determine the rule for the transformation of each cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid.\nA3: A3: The rule for the transformation of each cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid is as follows: The top left cell of the 2x2 square is the same as the original cell in the input grid. The top right cell of the 2x2 square is the same as the cell to the right of the original cell in the input grid. The bottom left cell of the 2x2 square is the same as the cell below the original cell in the input grid. The bottom right cell of the 2x2 square is the same as the cell diagonally right and below the original cell in the input grid. If the original cell is on the edge of the input grid, the cells outside the grid are assumed to be mirror images of the cells inside the grid.\n\n\nQ4: Apply this rule to transform the input grid of the quiz into the output grid.\nA4: A4: Applying the rule to the quiz input, the output grid would be:\n[[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]].\n\n",
