It does not undergo any transformation.\nA8: Combining the transformed areas and the untransformed areas, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[3, 0, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 4], [0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4], [0, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 4, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [1, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0]]."
