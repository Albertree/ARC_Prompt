The size of the grid changes from a 3x3 to a 9x9.\n2. Each row in the input grid is repeated three times in the output grid.\n3. Each value in the row of the input grid is repeated three times in the corresponding rows in the output grid.\n4. After the first three rows in the output grid, the rest of the rows are filled with zeros.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the input grid is repeated three times horizontally in the output grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, that's correct. Each row in the input grid is repeated three times horizontally in the output grid. This means that each value in the row of the input grid is also repeated three times in the corresponding rows in the output grid.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is [[6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3]], then the output grid would be:\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the repeated grids are separated by rows of zeros in the output grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. After the first three rows in the output grid, which are repetitions of the input grid, the rest of the rows are filled with zeros. This pattern of repeating the input grid followed by rows of zeros is consistent across all the examples.\n\n\nQ4: Determine the number of rows in the input grid and create that many copies of the input grid horizontally in the output grid.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The number of rows in the input grid determines the number of times the input grid is repeated horizontally in the output grid. For example, if the input grid has 3 rows, then the input grid is repeated 3 times horizontally in the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all the examples.\n\n\nQ5: Insert rows of zeros in between the repeated grids and at the top and bottom of the output grid.\nA5: A5: Yes, that's correct. After the first three rows in the output grid, which are repetitions of the input grid, the rest of the rows are filled with zeros. This pattern of repeating the input grid followed by rows of zeros is consistent across all the examples. The number of zero-filled rows is equal to the number of rows in the input grid.\n\n\nQ6: Apply these transformations to the input grid in the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA6: A6: Yes, that's correct. If we apply these transformations to the input grid in the quiz, we can generate the output grid. The input grid is [[6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3]]. So, we repeat each row in the input grid three times horizontally in the output grid, and then fill the rest of the rows with zeros. The output grid would be:\n\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n",
