The first part is used as the output grid. \nA3: Yes, the 7th column in the input grid always contains the number 2, which does not appear in the output grid. This column is removed during the transformation process.\nA4: The number 7 in the input grid is replaced by the number 1 in the output grid. This means that wherever there is a 7 in the input grid, there will be a 1 in the corresponding position in the output grid.\nA5: The number 0 in the input grid remains as 0 in the output grid. This means that wherever there is a 0 in the input grid, there will be a 0 in the corresponding position in the output grid.\nA6: The output grid for the quiz would be:\n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]]"

                "A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that the 7th column (index 6) is removed and the remaining columns are transformed such that any value of 7 is replaced with 1 and any value of 0 is replaced with 0. \nA2: Yes, the output grid is always a 5x6 grid. This is because the 7th column (index 6) is removed from the input grid, which is originally a 5x13 grid, resulting in a 5x12 grid. Then, the grid is divided into two equal parts, each of size 5x6.
