If the value is 4, then it contains the number 4. \nA3: If the cell contains the number 4, we can simply assign the value 2 to that cell to replace it. \nA4: To apply the same rule to all cells in the grid, we can use a nested loop to iterate over each cell in the grid. For each cell, we check if it is surrounded by 5s and if it contains the number 4. If both conditions are met, we replace the cell's value with 2. \n\nSo, the output grids will be:\n\n[[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]"
