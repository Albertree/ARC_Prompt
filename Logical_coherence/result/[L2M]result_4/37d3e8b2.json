So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The second shape is a rectangle located at the top right of the grid. The third shape is a square located at the bottom left of the grid. The fourth shape is a rectangle located at the bottom right of the grid. Each shape is separated by rows and columns of zeros.\n\n\nQ2: Determine the rules for changing the number 8 to a different number in the output grid.\nA2: A2: The rule for changing the number 8 to a different number in the output grid is based on the position of the shape formed by the number 8 in the input grid. Each distinct shape or pattern of 8s is assigned a different number in the output grid. The pattern is consistent across the examples, with the top-left pattern changing to 1, the top-right pattern changing to 2, the bottom-left pattern changing to 3, and the bottom-right pattern changing to 4.\n\n\nQ3: Apply the rules identified in Q2 to the input grid of the quiz.\nA3: A3: Applying the rules identified in Q2 to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ4: Identify any exceptions or special cases to the rules identified in Q2.\nA4: A4: The rules identified in Q2 seem to apply consistently across the provided examples and the quiz input. However, it's important to note that these rules are based on the specific patterns and shapes formed by the number 8 in the input grid. If the input grid were to contain different shapes or patterns, or if the number 8 were arranged in a different way, the rules might not apply. Therefore, while there are no explicit exceptions or special cases to the rules identified in Q2 based on the given examples, the rules are highly dependent on the specific arrangement of the number 8 in the input grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply any exceptions or special cases identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz.\nA5: A5: As mentioned in A4, there are no explicit exceptions or special cases identified based on the given examples. Therefore, there are no exceptions or special cases to apply to the input grid of the quiz. The rules identified in Q2 can be applied directly to the quiz input to obtain the output grid.\n\n",
