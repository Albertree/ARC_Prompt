So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 3], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1], [8, 3, 1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 3], [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [8, 3, 1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8], [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8], [8, 8, 1, 8, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 1, 8, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8], [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8], [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 9, 3, 1, 3, 9, 1, 9, 9], [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [9, 9, 3, 1, 3, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 3, 1, 3, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 3, 1, 3, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 1, 3, 1, 3, 7], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 1, 3, 1, 3, 7], [7, 3, 1, 3, 7, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 7], [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [7, 3, 1, 3, 7, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 3, 1, 3, 1, 7, 7], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 3, 1, 3, 1, 7, 7]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the positions of the number 1 in the input grid.\nA1: The positions of the number 1 in the input grid are at (2, 7), (5, 2), (11, 4), and (13, 13).\n\n\nQ2: For each position of 1, check the surrounding cells.\nA2: A2: For each position of 1, the surrounding cells are as follows:\n\n- For (2, 7), the surrounding cells are (1, 7), (3, 7), (2, 6), and (2, 8).
