If all the surrounding cells are 5, then the cell is surrounded by 5s. \nA2: To check if the identified cells from Q1 have a 4 in their immediate neighborhood, we need to iterate over each identified cell and check its surrounding cells. If any of the surrounding cells is 4, then the cell has a 4 in its immediate neighborhood.\nA3: To change the cell's value to 2 if it has a 4 in its immediate neighborhood, we simply assign the value 2 to the cell in the grid.\nA4: If a cell from Q1 does not have a 4 in its immediate neighborhood, we do not need to do anything. The cell's value remains the same.\n\nSo, the output grids are\n[[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]."
