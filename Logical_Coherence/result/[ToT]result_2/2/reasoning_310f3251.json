This results in a 2 appearing in the first column of each repeated input grid in the output. \nA6: The transformation of the non-zero numbers in the input grid to the same numbers in the output grid occurs in the center cell of each 3x3 grid that replaces each cell in the input grid. If the original cell value in the input grid was a non-zero number, that number is placed in the center of the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output. The rest of the cells in the 3x3 grid are 0, except for the top-left cell, which is always 2. \nA7: Applying these transformations to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]].\n\nThis output grid is generated by replacing each cell in the input grid with a 3x3 grid, placing the original cell value in the center, a 2 in the top-left, and filling the rest with 0s. This pattern is repeated for every cell in the input grid."
