                "A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that the 6th and 7th columns from the left and the 14th and 15th columns from the right are replaced with zeros. \nA2: Yes, that's correct. The 15th and 16th columns from the left (or the 6th and 7th columns from the right) of the input grid are replaced with 0s in the output grid. \nA3: Yes, this pattern applies to all rows in the input grid. Regardless of the row, the 15th and 16th columns from the left (or the 6th and 7th columns from the right) are replaced with 0s in the output grid.\nA4: The output grid for the quiz would be:\n\n[[4, 5, 7, 5, 9, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6, 9, 4, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 7], [9, 1, 7, 5, 5, 1, 2, 7, 1, 9, 1, 7, 4, 8, 0, 0, 2, 9, 5, 8], [9, 1, 8, 6, 9, 4, 7, 6, 9, 5, 5, 5, 8, 1, 0, 0, 4, 7, 8, 5], [4, 2, 9, 5, 5, 2, 8, 2, 7, 7, 9, 6, 1, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2, 3, 8, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 3, 5, 0, 0, 2, 6, 4, 6], [1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 5, 6, 2, 9], [7, 7, 1, 9, 2, 4, 6, 9, 1, 5, 5, 8, 5, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 1, 2], [2, 9, 6, 1, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 7, 0, 0, 2, 4, 7, 7], [4, 2, 6, 6, 8, 9, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 8, 3, 0, 0, 8, 5, 2, 1], [3, 2, 4, 8, 9, 8, 9, 5, 2, 1, 6, 8, 1, 2, 0, 0, 9, 1, 8, 5], [1, 3, 7, 2, 7, 3, 5, 2, 3, 9, 3, 2, 7, 2, 0, 0, 9, 8, 5, 7], [1, 6, 4, 6, 6, 5, 5, 9, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 7, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 6], [8, 6, 5, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 9, 6, 9, 4, 9, 0, 0, 1, 5, 9, 3], [3, 7, 7, 5, 9, 8, 7, 4, 2, 2, 9, 5, 0, 0, 8, 6, 7, 6, 6, 7], [6, 9, 5, 6, 3, 7, 5, 7, 9, 8, 9, 5, 0, 0, 4, 2, 3, 3, 2, 6], [2, 8, 5, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1, 4, 7, 4, 4, 9, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 7], [7, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7, 4, 6, 8, 5, 3, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 7], [4, 5, 9, 9, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9, 8, 5, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 5, 9, 8, 4], [1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1, 7, 4, 7, 8, 6, 0, 0, 5, 4, 9, 9], [2, 9, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 6, 4, 5, 8, 7, 5, 0, 0, 3, 6, 7, 3]]"
