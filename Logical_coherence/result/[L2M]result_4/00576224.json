So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 6], [6, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8], [4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6], [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 9], [4, 3]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3], [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7], [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4], [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 2], [7, 8]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the input and output grids of the examples.\nA1: The pattern in the input and output grids of the examples is that each 2x2 grid in the input is expanded to a 6x6 grid in the output. The first row of the input is repeated three times in the output, and the second row of the input is also repeated three times in the output. However, the order of the numbers in the second and fourth rows of the output is reversed compared to the input.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 6x6 grid, three times the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid. This is part of the pattern identified in the examples. The values from the input grid are repeated and rearranged to fill this larger grid. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is [[3, 2], [7, 8]], then the output grid would be [[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the first two rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's rows.\nA3: A3: Yes, the first two rows of the output grid are indeed repetitions of the input grid's rows. The first row of the input grid is repeated three times to form the first row of the output grid, and the second row of the input grid is repeated three times to form the second row of the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all examples.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the next two rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's rows but with the numbers in each pair swapped.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The third and fourth rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's rows, but with the numbers in each pair swapped. This means that the third row of the output grid is a repetition of the first row of the input grid with the numbers swapped, and the fourth row of the output grid is a repetition of the second row of the input grid with the numbers swapped. This pattern is also consistent across all examples.\n\n\nQ5: Observe that the last two rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's rows again.\nA5: A5: Yes, that's correct. The last two rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's rows. This means that the fifth row of the output grid is a repetition of the first row of the input grid, and the sixth row of the output grid is a repetition of the second row of the input grid. This pattern is consistent across all examples.\n\n\nQ6: Apply this pattern to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA6: A6: Applying the identified pattern to the input grid of the quiz, which is [[3, 2], [7, 8]], we get the output grid as [[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].\n\n",
