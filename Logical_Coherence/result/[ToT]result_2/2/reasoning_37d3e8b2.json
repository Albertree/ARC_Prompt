                "A1: The number 8 in the input grid forms different shapes or patterns. These shapes are isolated from each other and do not overlap. They can be in the form of a square, rectangle, or other irregular shapes. \nA2: The rule for changing the number 8 to another number in the output grid is based on the position of the shape in the grid. The first shape from the top changes to 1, the second shape changes to 2, the third shape changes to 3, and so on.\nA3: The relationship between the position of the number 8 in the input grid and the number it changes to in the output grid is based on the order of the shapes from top to bottom. The first shape of 8s from the top changes to 1s, the second shape of 8s changes to 2s, the third shape of 8s changes to 3s, and so on. The order is determined by the topmost cell of each shape. If two shapes have their topmost cell in the same row, the one on the left is considered first.\nA4: The first shape of 8s from the top changes to 1s, the second shape of 8s changes to 2s, the third shape of 8s changes to 3s, the fourth shape of 8s changes to 4s, and the fifth shape of 8s changes to 5s.
