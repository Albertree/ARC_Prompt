The input grid is divided into two halves horizontally. The top half contains the number 9 and the bottom half contains the number 4.\n\n2. The output grid is a 3x5 grid where the number 9 in the input grid is replaced by the number 6.\n\n3. The position of the number 6 in the output grid corresponds to the position of the number 9 in the input grid. However, the positions are mirrored along the vertical center line of the grid. \n\n4. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is always a 3x5 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, that's correct. The output grid is always a 3x5 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. This is part of the transformation pattern. The input grid is always reduced to a 3x5 grid in the output, with the positions of the number 9 from the input grid mirrored along the vertical center line and replaced with the number 6. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[9, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen the output grid would be \n[[0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe the transformation of the number 9 in the input grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, the transformation of the number 9 in the input grid is quite interesting. It seems to be replaced by the number 6 in the output grid. Moreover, its position is mirrored along the vertical center line of the grid. This means that if a 9 is on the left side of the input grid, it will appear on the right side of the output grid, and vice versa.\n\n\nQ4: Observe the transformation of the number 4 in the input grid.\nA4: A4: The number 4 in the input grid does not appear in the output grid. It seems to be ignored in the transformation process. The output grid only reflects the positions of the number 9 from the input grid, replaced with the number 6 and mirrored along the vertical center line. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s, regardless of whether they were 4s or 0s in the input grid.\n\n\nQ5: Observe the transformation of the number 0 in the input grid.\nA5: A5: The number 0 in the input grid seems to be the default value in the output grid. In the output grid, all cells that do not contain the transformed number 6 (which was 9 in the input grid) are filled with 0s. This is regardless of whether these cells contained 0s, 4s, or 9s in the input grid. The only exception is when a 9 from the input grid is transformed into a 6 in the output grid.\n\n\nQ6: Apply the rules found in Q2 to Q5 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA6: A6: Applying the rules found in Q2 to Q5 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\nIf the input grid is \n[[9, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen the output grid would be \n[[0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0]].\n\n",
