If the value is 1, then it contains the number 1. \nA6: If the cell contains the number 1, we can simply assign the value 6 to that cell in the grid. \nA7: To identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 7s, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its surrounding cells. If all the surrounding cells are 7, then the cell is surrounded by 7s. \nA8: To check if the identified cells from Q7 contain the number 0, we can simply check the value of the cell.
