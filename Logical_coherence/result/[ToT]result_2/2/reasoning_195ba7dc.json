                "A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid seems to be that the output grid is a 5x6 grid where each cell is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is not 2 and 0 if it is 2. The output grid is also shifted to the left by 6 cells compared to the input grid. \nA2: Yes, the output grid is always a 5x6 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. This suggests that the transformation process involves some form of reduction or compression of the input grid. \nA3: Yes, the 7th column in the input grid always contains the number 2, which does not appear in the output grid. This suggests that the number 2 might be used as a marker or separator in the transformation process. The cells to the right of this marker are the ones that are represented in the output grid.\nA4: Yes, the rule for transforming the cells in the input grid to the cells in the output grid seems to be that cells containing 7 in the input grid become 1 in the output grid, and cells containing 0 in the input grid remain 0 in the output grid. This rule applies to the cells to the right of the 7th column in the input grid, which contains the number 2.\nA5: Applying the rule identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]]"
