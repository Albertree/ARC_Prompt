                    "A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid seems to be related to the count of the number 8 in each row and column. If we look closely, we can see that the output grid is a 5x4 matrix where each cell corresponds to the count of the number 8 in the corresponding row or column of the input grid. The first two columns of the output grid correspond to the count of the number 8 in the first two rows of the input grid, and the last two columns of the output grid correspond to the count of the number 8 in the last two columns of the input grid. The same pattern applies to the rows of the output grid. \nA2: The output grid is a smaller version of the input grid. The size of the output grid is determined by the number of unique numbers in the input grid, excluding 0. In the examples, the input grid is a 5x9 matrix and the output grid is a 5x4 matrix. This is because there are 4 unique numbers in the input grid (8, 4, 5, and 0), and 0 is excluded. Therefore, the size of the output grid is 5x4.\nA3: The transformation of the values in the input grid to the output grid seems to be based on the presence of the number 8 in the corresponding row or column of the input grid. If the number 8 is present in the corresponding row or column of the input grid, the value in the output grid is 2. If the number 8 is not present, the value in the output grid is 0. This pattern is consistent across all the examples.\nA4: The rule for this transformation seems to be that if there is at least one number 8 in the corresponding row or column of the input grid, the value in the output grid is 2. If there is no number 8 in the corresponding row or column of the input grid, the value in the output grid is 0.
