The input grid is divided into four quadrants, separated by the rows and columns containing the number 3.\n\n2. Each quadrant is then transformed into a single cell in the output grid. The value of this cell is determined by the most frequent non-zero number in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid.\n\n3. If there is a tie for the most frequent non-zero number, the highest number is chosen.\n\n4. The output grid is arranged in the same order as the quadrants in the input grid. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the top left quadrant of the input grid contains the numbers 8 and 0, with 8 being the most frequent non-zero number. Therefore, the top left cell of the output grid is 8. The process is repeated for the other quadrants to form the complete output grid.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 4x4 grid, which is a smaller version of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 4x4 grid, which is a smaller version of the input grid. This is because the input grid is divided into four quadrants, and each quadrant is represented by a single cell in the output grid. The value of each cell in the output grid is determined by the most frequent non-zero number in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid. If there is a tie for the most frequent non-zero number, the highest number is chosen. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nBased on the pattern identified, the output grid for the quiz input would be:\n[[9, 5], [8, 4]]\n\n\nQ3: Identify the relationship between the numbers in the input grid and the output grid.\nA3: A3: The relationship between the numbers in the input grid and the output grid is that each number in the output grid represents the most frequent non-zero number in each quadrant of the input grid. If there is a tie for the most frequent non-zero number, the highest number is chosen. This means that the output grid is a condensed representation of the input grid, where each cell in the output grid represents a quadrant of the input grid.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the output grid is formed by taking the maximum number in each 4x4 sub-grid of the input grid.\nA4: A4: Actually, the output grid is not formed by taking the maximum number in each 4x4 sub-grid of the input grid. Instead, it is formed by taking the most frequent non-zero number in each quadrant of the input grid. If there is a tie for the most frequent non-zero number, the highest number is chosen. The input grid is divided into four quadrants by the rows and columns containing the number 3. Each quadrant is then represented by a single cell in the output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the same transformation to the input grid of the quiz.\nA5: A5: Applying the same transformation to the input grid of the quiz, we first divide the input grid into four quadrants separated by the rows and columns containing the number 3. Then, for each quadrant, we find the most frequent non-zero number. If there is a tie for the most frequent non-zero number, we choose the highest number. \n\nThe quadrants and their most frequent non-zero numbers are as follows:\n\n- Top left quadrant: 8\n- Top right quadrant: 5\n- Bottom left quadrant: 8\n- Bottom right quadrant: 4\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the quiz input is:\n\n[[8, 5], [8, 4]]\n\n",
