So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

the input grid.\nA1: The pattern of the input grid is that it contains a larger grid of 0s, and within this grid, there are two smaller grids filled with numbers 3 and 8. These smaller grids are separated by a column of 0s. The numbers 3 and 8 form specific patterns within these smaller grids.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of the output grid.\nA2: A2: The pattern of the output grid is that it is a smaller grid that only contains the numbers from the smaller grids in the input, excluding the column of 0s that separated them. The patterns of numbers 3 and 8 from the input grid are preserved in the output grid.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the relationship between the input and output grids.\nA3: A3: The relationship between the input and output grids is that the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid. It removes the larger grid of 0s and the column of 0s that separated the two smaller grids in the input, leaving only the numbers 3 and 8 and their patterns.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the specific positions of the 3s in the input grid.\nA4: A4: The specific positions of the 3s in the input grid vary, but they generally appear in a pattern where they alternate with the number 8. They are located within the smaller grids inside the larger grid of 0s. The exact positions can vary depending on the specific input grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the same pattern of 3s within the 8s to the output grid.\nA5: A5: The pattern of 3s within the 8s from the input grid is preserved in the output grid. The 3s appear in the same relative positions within the grid of 8s in the output as they did in the input. The exact positions can vary depending on the specific input grid.\n\n\nQ6: Crop the outer layer of 0s from the input grid to generate the output grid.\nA6: A6: Yes, the output grid is generated by cropping the outer layer of 0s from the input grid. This includes removing the column of 0s that separated the two smaller grids in the input. The remaining numbers 3 and 8 and their patterns form the output grid.\n\n",
