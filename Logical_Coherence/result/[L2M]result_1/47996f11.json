So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 9, 5, 5, 9, 4, 8, 8, 4, 5, 7, 7, 3,

problem in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset introduced by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, the creator of the Keras deep learning library. The ARC problem involves identifying patterns in a given input grid and applying these patterns to transform the grid into an output grid.\n\nIn the given problem, the pattern seems to involve identifying cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 6s. However, the problem statement does not provide enough information to determine how to identify these cells or what to do with them once they are identified. \n\nIn the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves shifting the values in the grid to the right. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine the exact pattern or rule that should be applied. \n\nIn the context of the ARC, these problems are typically solved using machine learning algorithms that can learn to identify and apply these patterns based on a set of training examples. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to provide a specific solution to this problem.\n\n\nQ2: Change the color of the cells identified in Q1 to 6.\nA2: A2: The problem statement does not provide a clear method for identifying which cells are surrounded by 6s. However, if we assume that a cell is considered \"surrounded\" if it has a 6 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.\n2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain a 6, change the value of the current cell to 6.\n\nThis approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to a 6 being changed to a 6. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 8s.\nA3: A3: Similar to the previous question, the problem statement does not provide a clear method for identifying which cells are surrounded by 8s. However, if we assume that a cell is considered \"surrounded\" if it has an 8 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.\n2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain an 8, mark the current cell as surrounded by 8s.\n\nThis approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to an 8 being marked as surrounded by 8s. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.\n\n\nQ4: Change the color of the cells identified in Q3 to 8.\nA4: A4: Similar to the previous answers, if we assume that a cell is considered \"surrounded\" if it has an 8 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.\n2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain an 8, change the value of the current cell to 8.\n\nThis approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to an 8 being changed to an 8. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.\n\n\nQ5: Identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 9s.\nA5: A5: Similar to the previous questions, the problem statement does not provide a clear method for identifying which cells are surrounded by 9s. However, if we assume that a cell is considered \"surrounded\" if it has a 9 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.\n2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain a 9, mark the current cell as surrounded by 9s.\n\nThis approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to a 9 being marked as surrounded by 9s. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.\n\n\nQ6: Change the color of the cells identified in Q5 to 9.\nA6: A6: Similar to the previous answers, if we assume that a cell is considered \"surrounded\" if it has a 9 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.\n2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain a 9, change the value of the current cell to 9.\n\nThis approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to a 9 being changed to a 9. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.\n\n",
