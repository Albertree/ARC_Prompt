The value of the cell in the input grid determines the pattern of the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid.\nA4: The transformation of each cell in the input grid to a 3x3 subgrid in the output grid is as follows: If the cell in the input grid is 0, the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid is all 0s. If the cell in the input grid is not 0, the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid has the same value in the same relative positions as the non-zero value in the input grid. For example, if the cell in the input grid is in the top middle position, the non-zero value in the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output grid will also be in the top middle position.\nA5: Applying the transformation rules identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]]."
