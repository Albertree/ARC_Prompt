The size of the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions (rows and columns). If the input grid is of size m x n, the output grid is of size 3m x 3n.\n\n2. Each cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. For example, if a cell in the input grid is at position (i, j), the corresponding cells in the output grid are at positions (3i, 3j), (3i, 3j+1), (3i, 3j+2), (3i+1, 3j), (3i+1, 3j+1), (3i+1, 3j+2), (3i+2, 3j), (3i+2, 3j+1), and (3i+2, 3j+2).\n\n3. For each group of nine cells in the output grid that correspond to a single cell in the input grid, the cell at the top left corner (position (3i, 3j)) is replaced with the number 2 if the original cell in the input grid was 0. The rest of the cells in the group retain the value of the original cell in the input grid.\n\nSo, for the quiz, the output grid would be:\n\n[[2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, that's correct. The output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This means that each cell in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid. This is a key part of the transformation pattern in these examples.\n\n\nQ3: Observe that every cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. Each cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. This means that for each cell in the input grid, there is a corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid where all cells have the same value as the original cell, except for the top left cell of the block which is replaced with the number 2 if the original cell was 0.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the rule for transforming the value of each cell in the input grid to the corresponding cells in the output grid.\nA4: A4: The rule for transforming the value of each cell in the input grid to the corresponding cells in the output grid is as follows:\n\n1. If the value of the cell in the input grid is 0, then the top left cell of the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is replaced with the number 2. The rest of the cells in the block retain the value 0.\n\n2. If the value of the cell in the input grid is not 0, then all the cells in the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid retain the same value as the original cell.\n\nThis rule is applied to each cell in the input grid to generate the output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Notice that the cells in the output grid that correspond to the cells in the input grid that have a value of 0 are transformed to a value of 2.\nA5: A5: Yes, that's correct. In the output grid, the top left cell of each 3x3 block that corresponds to a cell in the input grid with a value of 0 is transformed to a value of 2. The rest of the cells in the block retain the value 0. This is a key part of the transformation pattern in these examples.\n\n\nQ6: Apply these rules to transform the input grid of the quiz to the output grid.\nA6: A6: Applying the rules identified from the examples to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] \n\nThis output grid is obtained by replicating each cell in the input grid three times in both dimensions, and replacing the top left cell of each 3x3 block corresponding to a cell with a value of 0 in the input grid with the number 2.\n\n",
