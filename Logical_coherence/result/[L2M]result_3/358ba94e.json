Each shape is a 5x5 square with a cross pattern inside. The cross pattern is made by removing the corners and the center of the square. The two shapes are located in the upper left and lower right corners of the grid.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the size of the square.\nA2: A2: The size of the square is 5x5.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the position of the square.\nA3: A3: The first square is located in the upper left corner of the grid, starting from the second row and second column. The second square is located in the lower right corner of the grid, starting from the ninth row and ninth column.\n\n\nQ4: Identify any changes in the square.\nA4: A4: The squares remain the same throughout the grid.
