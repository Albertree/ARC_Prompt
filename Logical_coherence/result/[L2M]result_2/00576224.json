So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 6], [6, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8], [4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6], [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 9], [4, 3]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3], [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7], [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4], [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 2], [7, 8]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the input and output grids of the examples.\nA1: A1: The pattern in the input and output grids is that the 2x2 input grid is expanded to a 6x6 output grid. Each 2x2 block in the output grid is a copy of the input grid, and the blocks alternate between being a direct copy and a mirrored copy (flipped along the vertical axis).\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This is part of the pattern - the input grid is expanded by replicating it both horizontally and vertically. The replication also includes a mirroring effect, where every alternate block is a mirrored version of the input grid.\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid three times horizontally.\nA3: A3: Yes, the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid three times horizontally. However, it's important to note that every alternate repetition is a mirrored version of the input grid. This pattern is also repeated vertically, resulting in a 6x6 grid. \n\nQuiz Answer: \n[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]\n\n\nQ4: Also, notice that the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid and its transpose alternately three times vertically.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The output grid is formed by repeating the input grid and its mirrored version alternately three times vertically. This pattern of alternating between the original and mirrored version of the input grid is repeated both horizontally and vertically, resulting in the final 6x6 output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the same pattern to the quiz input grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the same pattern to the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]\n\n",
