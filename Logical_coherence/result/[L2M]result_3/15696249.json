The first row consists of two 6's and one 3, while the second and third rows consist of two 4's and one 3.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 9x9 grid, three times the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 9x9 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid. The pattern in the output grid is that the original 3x3 grid is repeated three times horizontally, and then this pattern is repeated vertically to fill the 9x9 grid. However, there are also rows of zeros inserted between each repetition of the original grid. \n\nQ3: What is the pattern of the zeros in the output grid?\nA3: The pattern of the zeros in the output grid is that they fill the rows that are not occupied by the repeated original grid. Specifically, there are three rows of zeros at the top of the grid, three rows of zeros in the middle, and three rows of zeros at the bottom.\n\nQ4: How can we apply this pattern to the quiz input grid to get the output grid?\nA4: We can apply this pattern to the quiz input grid by first repeating the input grid three times horizontally, and then repeating this pattern vertically. We then insert three rows of zeros at the top, middle, and bottom of the grid. \n\nQuiz Answer:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the first three rows of the input grid are repeated three times in the output grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. The first three rows of the input grid are indeed repeated three times in the output grid. This pattern is then repeated vertically to fill the 9x9 grid. However, there are also rows of zeros inserted between each repetition of the original grid.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the remaining rows in the output grid are filled with zeros.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The remaining rows in the output grid are filled with zeros. Specifically, there are three rows of zeros at the top of the grid, three rows of zeros in the middle, and three rows of zeros at the bottom. This pattern of zeros is consistent across all the examples provided.\n\n\nQ5: Apply this pattern to the quiz input grid to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: To apply this pattern to the quiz input grid, we first repeat each row of the input grid three times horizontally. This gives us the following 3x9 grid:\n\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3]]\n\nNext, we repeat this 3x9 grid three times vertically, and insert three rows of zeros at the top, middle, and bottom of the grid. This gives us the final 9x9 output grid:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n",
