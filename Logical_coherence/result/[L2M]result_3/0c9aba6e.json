So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 0, 6, 6], [0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the rows in the input grid that are filled with the number 7.\nA1: A1: The row filled with the number 7 in the input grid is the 7th row: [7, 7, 7, 7].\n\n\nQ2: Remove these rows from the input grid.\nA2: A2: After removing the row filled with the number 7, the input grid becomes:\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the remaining rows that contain the number 2.\nA3: A3: The remaining rows that contain the number 2 are: \n1st row: [0, 0, 0, 2], \n2nd row: [0, 2, 2, 0], \n3rd row: [2, 0, 0, 2], \n4th row: [0, 2, 2, 0], \n5th row: [2, 0, 2, 2], \n6th row: [0, 0, 0, 2].\n\n\nQ4: Replace the number 2 with the number 8 in these rows.\nA4: A4: After replacing the number 2 with the number 8 in these rows, the grid becomes:\n[[0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6]].\n\n\nQ5: Remove the remaining rows that do not contain the number 8.\nA5: After removing the remaining rows that do not contain the number 8, the output grid becomes:\n[[0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8]].\n\n\nQ5: Identify the remaining rows that contain the number 6.\nA5: A5: There are no remaining rows that contain the number 6 after the previous steps.
