The number of 2's in each row and column of the output grid is equal to the number of 8's in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. \n\nAlso, the output grid is a 4x4 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. The first two columns of the output grid correspond to the count of 8's in the first four columns of the input grid, and the last two columns of the output grid correspond to the count of 8's in the last five columns of the input grid. \n\nThe same rule applies to the rows. The first two rows of the output grid correspond to the count of 8's in the first three rows of the input grid, and the last two rows of the output grid correspond to the count of 8's in the last two rows of the input grid. \n\nIf there are no 8's in a certain row or column of the input grid, the corresponding row or column of the output grid will be filled with 0's.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 4x4 grid, which is smaller than the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always a 4x4 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. This is because the transformation rule involves counting the number of 8's in certain sections of the input grid and representing this count as 2's in the output grid. The input grid is divided into four sections (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right), and the count of 8's in each section is represented in the corresponding section of the output grid. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]],\n\nthen the output grid would be \n[[2, 2, 0, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the output grid is formed by dividing the input grid into 4 equal parts and replacing each part with a single value.\nA3: A3: Yes, the output grid is formed by dividing the input grid into four sections and replacing each section with a single value. This value is the count of the number 8 in that section of the input grid, represented as the number 2 in the output grid. If there are no 8's in a certain section of the input grid, the corresponding section of the output grid will be filled with 0's.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the value 2 in the output grid corresponds to the presence of the value 8 in the corresponding part of the input grid.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The number 2 in the output grid represents the presence of the number 8 in the corresponding section of the input grid. The number of 2's in each section of the output grid is equal to the number of 8's in the corresponding section of the input grid. If there are no 8's in a certain section of the input grid, the corresponding section of the output grid will be filled with 0's.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the rules determined in Q2, Q3 and Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the rules determined in Q2, Q3 and Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we can generate the output grid. \n\nFirst, we divide the input grid into four sections and count the number of 8's in each section. \n\nThe input grid is:\n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]]\n\nThe count of 8's in each section is:\nTop left: 6\nTop right: 6\nBottom left: 6\nBottom right: 6\n\nThen, we replace each section of the input grid with the count of 8's in that section, represented as the number 2 in the output grid. \n\nSo, the output grid is:\n[[2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2]]\n\n",
