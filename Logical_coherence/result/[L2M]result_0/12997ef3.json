It is located at the top left corner of the grid. The pattern is formed by two consecutive 1s in the second row, followed by two consecutive 1s in the third and fourth rows, starting from the first column.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the input grid.\nA2: A2: The pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the input grid is that they are all located in the seventh row, with 0s in between them. The pattern starts with 2, followed by 8, then 3, and finally 6.\n\n\nQ3: Determine the transformation from the pattern of 1s to the output grid in the examples.\nA3: A3: The transformation from the pattern of 1s to the output grid in the examples is that the pattern of 1s is replicated three times in the output grid. The first time, the pattern is filled with 0s. The second time, the pattern is filled with the number that is in the same column as the pattern in the input grid. The third time, the pattern is filled with 0s again.\n\n\nQ4: Determine the transformation from the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 to the output grid in the examples.\nA4: A4: The transformation from the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 to the output grid in the examples is that each number is used to fill the replicated pattern of 1s in the output grid. The number 2 fills the first replicated pattern, the number 3 fills the second replicated pattern, and so on. The pattern is filled in the same order as the numbers appear in the input grid.\n\nQ5: Apply the transformations to the quiz input grid to determine the output grid.\nA5: The output grid would be:\n[[0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6], \n [2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0], \n [0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6]].\n\n\nQ5: Apply the transformation from Q3 to the pattern of 1s in the quiz input grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the transformation from Q3 to the pattern of 1s in the quiz input grid, we get three replicated patterns of 1s. The first and third patterns are filled with 0s, and the second pattern is filled with the number that is in the same column as the pattern in the input grid. However, since there are no numbers in the same column as the pattern of 1s in the quiz input grid, the second pattern is also filled with 0s.\n\n\nQ6: Apply the transformation from Q4 to the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the quiz input grid.\nA6: A6: Applying the transformation from Q4 to the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the quiz input grid, we get three replicated patterns of 1s for each number. The first pattern is filled with 2, the second pattern is filled with 8, the third pattern is filled with 3, and the fourth pattern is filled with 6. The patterns are filled in the same order as the numbers appear in the input grid.\n\n\nQ7: Combine the results from Q5 and Q6 to generate the output grid for the quiz.\nA7: A7: Combining the results from Q5 and Q6, the output grid for the quiz would be:\n[[0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6], \n [2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0], \n [0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6]].\n\n",
