                    "A1: The pattern of the number 1 in the input grid is a 5x5 square with a cross inside. The cross is formed by removing the second and fourth elements from the second and fourth rows. This pattern is repeated four times in different locations of the grid.\nA2: Yes, the pattern of 1s forms a square shape in the input grid. The square is 5x5 in size and is repeated four times in different locations of the grid. \nA3: The center of the square shape formed by the 1s is the third element of the third row within each 5x5 square.\nA4: Yes, the center of the square shape is empty (0) in the input grid. This is part of the cross pattern within each 5x5 square. The second and fourth elements of the second and fourth rows are removed to form the cross, leaving the center of the square empty.\nA5: The size of the square shape formed by the 1s is 5x5.\nA6: Yes, the size of the square shape is 5x5 in the output grid. This is consistent with the size of the square shape in the input grid. \nA7: The pattern of the number 1 in the output grid is a 5x5 square with a cross inside. The cross is formed by removing the second and fourth elements from the second and fourth rows. This pattern is consistent with the pattern of the number 1 in the input grid.\nA8: Yes, the pattern of 1s forms a cross shape in the output grid. The cross is formed by removing the second and fourth elements from the second and fourth rows within each 5x5 square. This is consistent with the pattern of the number 1 in the input grid. \nA9: The center of the cross shape formed by the 1s is the third element of the third row within each 5x5 square. This is consistent with the center of the square shape in the input grid. \nA10: Yes, the center of the cross shape is filled (1) in the output grid. This is a change from the input grid, where the center of the square shape was empty (0). \nA11: The size of the cross shape formed by the 1s is 5x5. This is consistent with the size of the square shape in the input grid.\nA12: Yes, the size of the cross shape is 5x5 in the output grid. This is consistent with the size of the square shape in the input grid. \nA13: The transformation from the square shape to the cross shape involves filling in the center of the square (which was empty in the input grid) with the number 1 in the output grid. This changes the pattern from a square with a cross inside to a full cross.\nA14: No, the transformation does not involve changing the 1s in the corners of the square shape to 0s. The transformation only involves changing the 0 in the center of the square shape to 1. The 1s in the corners of the square shape remain as 1s in the output grid.\nA15: The transformation involves changing the 0 in the center of each 5x5 square to 1. Applying this transformation to the input grid generates the output grid:\n\n[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]."
