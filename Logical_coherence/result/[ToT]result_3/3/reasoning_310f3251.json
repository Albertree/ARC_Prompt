However, the replicated cells are not identical to the original cell. The center cell of the 3x3 grid is the same as the original cell, and the other cells are filled with 2 if the original cell was 0, and filled with 0 if the original cell was not 0.\nA4: Yes, the rule for transforming the value of each cell in the input grid to the corresponding cells in the output grid is as follows: If the cell in the input grid has a value of 0, then the corresponding cells in the output grid will have a value of 2, except for the center cell which retains its original value. If the cell in the input grid has a value other than 0, then the corresponding cells in the output grid will have a value of 0, except for the center cell which retains its original value.\nA5: Applying the transformation rule to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
