The dividing line between the upper and lower half is the middle row of the grid.\n\nQ3: Identify the cells that are surrounded by '2's on all four sides and have a '2' in the middle.\nA3: The cells that are surrounded by '2's on all four sides and have a '2' in the middle are the ones that are inside the rectangles formed by '2's and have a '2' in the middle. These cells are initially '0's and are enclosed within the '2's.\n\nQ4: Replace the identified cells from Q3 with '2'.\nA4: The cells identified in Q3 are replaced with '2'. This maintains the '2' in the middle of the rectangles formed by '2's.\n\nSo, the output grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
