The zeros form a rectangular block that spans multiple rows and columns. The block of zeros is also mirrored along the center of the grid.\nA3: The pattern of numbers that should replace the zeros is the same sequence of numbers that is present in the rest of the grid. The sequence should continue uninterrupted, as if the zeros were not there. The sequence should also be mirrored along the center of the grid, just like the rest of the numbers.\nA4: To replace the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers, we need to continue the sequence of numbers from the surrounding cells. The sequence should continue as if the zeros were not there, and it should also be mirrored along the center of the grid. \nA5: Apart from replacing the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers, there are no other changes in the grid from input to output.

                "A1: The pattern of numbers in the input grid is a sequence of numbers that repeats after a certain interval. The sequence starts with 1 and increases by 1 each time, up to a certain number, then it resets back to 1 and repeats. The sequence is separated by the number 4, which acts as a boundary. The sequence also appears to be mirrored along the center of the grid. \nA2: The pattern is interrupted by zeros in the middle of the grid. The zeros form a rectangular block that spans multiple rows and columns. The block of zeros is also mirrored along the center of the grid.\nA3: The pattern of numbers that should replace the zeros is the same sequence of numbers that is present in the rest of the grid. The sequence should continue uninterrupted, as if the zeros were not there. The sequence should also be mirrored along the center of the grid, just like the rest of the numbers.\nA4: To replace the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers, we need to continue the sequence of numbers from the surrounding cells.
