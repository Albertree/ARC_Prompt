                    "A1: To identify the cells that are surrounded by '3's on all four sides in the input grid, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its four neighbors (top, bottom, left, and right). If all four neighbors are '3', then the cell is surrounded by '3's. \nA2: To check if the identified cells are part of a larger square or rectangle of '3's, we can expand the check from Q1 to include the cells diagonally adjacent to the current cell. If these cells are also '3's, then the current cell is part of a larger square or rectangle of '3's.\nA3: To replace the '3's at the corners of the square or rectangle with '4's, we can iterate over the cells in the square or rectangle and check if they are at a corner. A cell is at a corner if it has two '3's as neighbors that are not adjacent to each other. If a cell is at a corner, we replace the '3' with a '4'.\nA4: To replace the '3's with '2's, we can iterate over the cells in the grid and check if they are '3's and not part of a larger square or rectangle (as determined in Q2). If a cell is a '3' and not part of a larger square or rectangle, we replace the '3' with a '2'. \nA5: To repeat this process for all cells identified in Q1, we can put the steps from Q1 to Q4 into a loop that iterates over all cells in the grid.
