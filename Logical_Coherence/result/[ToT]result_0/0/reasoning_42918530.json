If a cell is in the middle row of a shape and is 0, it is changed to the same number as the border of the shape.\nA6: Applying the rule to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
