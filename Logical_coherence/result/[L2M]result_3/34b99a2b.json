If there are 1 or 2 occurrences of 8, they are replaced with 2 in the output grid. If there are 3 or 4 occurrences of 8, they are replaced with 0 in the output grid. \n\nIn each column of the input grid, the number of 8's is counted. If there are 1 or 2 occurrences of 8, they are replaced with 2 in the output grid. If there are 3 or 4 occurrences of 8, they are replaced with 0 in the output grid. \n\nThe output grid is a 5x4 grid, which is a subset of the input grid. The output grid is formed by the 2nd to 5th columns of the input grid. \n\nThe numbers 4 and 5 in the input grid are ignored in the output grid.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is always 4 columns wide.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always 4 columns wide. This is because the transformation pattern only considers the 2nd to 5th columns of the input grid. The first column and the last four columns of the input grid are ignored in the output grid.\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the values in the output grid are derived from the values in the input grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, the values in the output grid are derived from the values in the input grid. Specifically, the values in the output grid are determined by the count of the number 8 in each row and column of the input grid. If there are 1 or 2 occurrences of 8, they are replaced with 2 in the output grid. If there are 3 or 4 occurrences of 8, they are replaced with 0 in the output grid. The numbers 4 and 5 in the input grid are ignored in the output grid.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]],\nthen the output grid would be \n[[2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2]].\n\n\nQ4: Determine the rule for transforming the values.\nA4: A4: The rule for transforming the values from the input grid to the output grid is as follows:\n\n1. Count the number of 8's in each row and column of the input grid.\n2. If there are 1 or 2 occurrences of 8 in a row or column, replace them with 2 in the output grid.\n3. If there are 3 or 4 occurrences of 8 in a row or column, replace them with 0 in the output grid.\n4. Ignore the numbers 4 and 5 in the input grid.\n5. The output grid is a 5x4 grid, which is a subset of the input grid. The output grid is formed by the 2nd to 5th columns of the input grid. The first column and the last four columns of the input grid are ignored in the output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply these rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the rules to the input grid of the quiz:\n\nInput grid:\n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]]\n\nCount the number of 8's in each row and column of the input grid (considering only the 2nd to 5th columns):\n\nRow 1: 1 occurrence of 8 -> replace with 2\nRow 2: 2 occurrences of 8 -> replace with 2\nRow 3: 3 occurrences of 8 -> replace with 0\nRow 4: 4 occurrences of 8 -> replace with 0\nRow 5: 2 occurrences of 8 -> replace with 2\n\nColumn 2: 3 occurrences of 8 -> replace with 0\nColumn 3: 2 occurrences of 8 -> replace with 2\nColumn 4: 4 occurrences of 8 -> replace with 0\nColumn 5: 2 occurrences of 8 -> replace with 2\n\nOutput grid:\n[[2, 0, 2, 2], \n [2, 0, 0, 2], \n [0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 2, 2]]\n\n",
