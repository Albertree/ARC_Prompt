This can be done by simply setting the value of the cell to 2 if it is currently a 5.\nA4: After changing the surrounding 5s to 2s for one cell, we need to repeat the process for all other cells in the grid. This can be done by looping over the entire grid again and repeating the steps for each cell. Once all cells have been processed, the output grid will be the final result. \n\nSo, the output grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]."
