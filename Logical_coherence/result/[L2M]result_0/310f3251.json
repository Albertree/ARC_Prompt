The size of the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions (rows and columns). \n\n2. Each cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. \n\n3. For every cell in the output grid that corresponds to a cell in the input grid that had a value of 0, if the cell is in an odd-numbered row and column (starting count from 0), the cell's value is changed to 2. All other cells retain their original value from the input grid.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input grid is [[0, 0], [0, 7]]. This is transformed into the output grid [[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7]]. The size of the grid has been tripled, and each cell in the input grid has been replicated three times in both dimensions. The cells in the output grid that correspond to cells in the input grid with a value of 0 and are in an odd-numbered row and column have been changed to 2.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This means that if the input grid has m rows and n columns, the output grid will have 3m rows and 3n columns. This is a consistent pattern across all the examples provided. \n\nQ3: Apply the identified pattern to the quiz input grid to find the output grid.\nA3: The quiz input grid is [[0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]. Applying the identified pattern, the output grid will be:\n\n[[2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ3: Observe that every cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. Each cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. This means that the value of each cell in the input grid is copied to a 3x3 block in the output grid. However, there is an exception for cells with a value of 0 in the input grid. In the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid, the cells in odd-numbered rows and columns are changed to 2. This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided.\n\n\nQ4: Identify that the first cell of every three cells in the output grid is filled with 2 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 0.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. If the corresponding cell in the input grid has a value of 0, the first cell of every three cells in the output grid (both in terms of rows and columns) is filled with 2. This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided. This means that in the output grid, for every 3x3 block that corresponds to a cell with a value of 0 in the input grid, the cells in odd-numbered rows and columns are changed to 2.\n\n\nQ5: Apply these transformations to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: The quiz input grid is [[0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]. Applying the transformations, the output grid will be:\n\n[[2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n",
