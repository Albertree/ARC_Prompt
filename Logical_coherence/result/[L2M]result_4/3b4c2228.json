So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 5\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [3, 0, 2, 2, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the positions of the number 3 in the input grid.\nA1: The positions of the number 3 in the input grid are: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (5,0), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1).\n\n\nQ2: Count the number of 3s in each row and column.\nA2: A2: The count of number 3 in each row and column is as follows:\n\nRows:\nRow 1: 2\nRow 2: 2\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 1\nRow 5: 2\nRow 6: 2\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 0\n\nColumns:\nColumn 1: 4\nColumn 2: 4\nColumn 3: 0\nColumn 4: 0\nColumn 5: 1\n\n\nQ3: Identify the positions of the number 2 in the input grid.\nA3: A3: The positions of the number 2 in the input grid are: (3,0), (6,3), (6,4), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n\nQ4: Count the number of 2s in each row and column.\nA4: A4: The count of number 2 in each row and column is as follows:\n\nRows:\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 1\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 2\nRow 7: 2\nRow 8: 0\n\nColumns:\nColumn 1: 1\nColumn 2: 0\nColumn 3: 0\nColumn 4: 2\nColumn 5: 2\n\n\nQ5: Create a new 3x3 grid.\nA5: A5: A new 3x3 grid can be created as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ6: Fill the new grid with the count of 3s and 2s in the input grid.\nA6: The new grid filled with the count of 3s and 2s in the input grid is as follows:\n\n[[1, 0, 0], \n [0, 1, 0], \n [0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ6: In the new grid, fill the top left cell with the number of rows in the input grid that contain more 3s than 2s.\nA6: A6: The number of rows in the input grid that contain more 3s than 2s is 1.
