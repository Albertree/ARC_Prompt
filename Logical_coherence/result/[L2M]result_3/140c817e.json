The remaining numbers in the grid, which are not 1 or 2, are changed to 1.\n\n\nQ5: Change all the remaining 8s to 1.\nA5: A5: Yes, all the remaining 8s in the grid are changed to 1. This results in the final output grid.\n\n\nQ6: Change all the remaining 3s to 1.\nA6: A6: There seems to be a misunderstanding. According to the pattern identified from the examples, we do not have any 3s in the final output grid.
