The input grid is divided into four quadrants, each quadrant is a 3x3 grid. The output grid is a 4x4 grid where each cell corresponds to the count of the number 8 in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the top left quadrant of the input grid has two 8's, so the top left cell of the output grid is 2. The top right quadrant of the input grid has no 8's, so the top right cell of the output grid is 0. The bottom left quadrant of the input grid has two 8's, so the bottom left cell of the output grid is 2. The bottom right quadrant of the input grid has no 8's, so the bottom right cell of the output grid is 0. \n\nThis pattern is consistent across all the examples.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is always 4 columns wide.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always 4 columns wide. This is because the input grid is divided into four quadrants, and each quadrant is represented by a single cell in the output grid. Therefore, the output grid will always have 4 columns, regardless of the size or content of the input grid.\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the values in the output grid are determined by the values in the input grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, the values in the output grid are determined by the count of the number 8 in each quadrant of the input grid. The output grid does not contain any values other than these counts. Therefore, the output grid is a kind of summary or compression of the input grid, where the specific detail of the number 8's distribution in each quadrant is lost, but the overall count is preserved.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]],\nthen the output grid would be\n[[2, 1, 1, 0], [3, 1, 1, 2], [2, 2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 0, 1]].\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the cells in the output grid correspond to the cells in the input grid in the following way: the first column in the output grid corresponds to the second column in the input grid, the second column corresponds to the fourth column, the third column corresponds to the seventh column, and the fourth column corresponds to the ninth column.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The cells in the output grid correspond to the quadrants in the input grid. The first column in the output grid corresponds to the count of the number 8 in the first and second columns and first three rows in the input grid. The second column in the output grid corresponds to the count of the number 8 in the fourth and fifth columns and first three rows in the input grid. The third column in the output grid corresponds to the count of the number 8 in the seventh and eighth columns and last three rows in the input grid. The fourth column in the output grid corresponds to the count of the number 8 in the ninth and tenth columns and last three rows in the input grid. This pattern is consistent across all the examples and the quiz.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the observed transformation rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: To generate the output grid from the input grid of the quiz, we count the number of 8's in each quadrant of the input grid. \n\nThe input grid is:\n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]]\n\nThe count of 8's in each quadrant is:\nTop left quadrant: 3\nTop right quadrant: 1\nBottom left quadrant: 4\nBottom right quadrant: 2\n\nSo, the output grid is:\n[[3, 1], \n [4, 2]]\n\n",
