So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

the input grid.\nA1: The pattern of the input grid is that there are two distinct shapes or objects, each made up of the numbers 3 and 8, separated by rows and columns of zeros. The first object is located at the top left corner of the grid and the second object is located at the bottom right corner. The objects are surrounded by zeros on all sides.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the positions of the 3s in the input grid.\nA2: A2: The positions of the 3s in the input grid are scattered throughout the two objects. In the first object, the 3s are located in the second column and the fifth column, and they form a pattern that resembles the letter 'X'. In the second object, the 3s are located in the thirteenth and sixteenth columns, and they form a pattern that resembles the letter 'X' as well.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the pattern of the output grid.\nA3: A3: The pattern of the output grid is that it is a smaller grid that contains only the object from the input grid, without any of the surrounding zeros. The object is made up of the numbers 3 and 8, and the 3s form a pattern that resembles the letter 'X'.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\nA4: A4: The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves removing the rows and columns of zeros that surround the object in the input grid. This results in a smaller grid that contains only the object. The positions of the numbers 3 and 8 within the object remain the same in the output grid as they were in the input grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the transformation identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves removing the rows and columns of zeros that surround the object in the input grid. This results in a smaller grid that contains only the object. The positions of the numbers 3 and 8 within the object remain the same in the output grid as they were in the input grid.\n\nSo, if we apply this transformation to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be:\n\n[[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 3, 8], \n [8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3], \n [8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 3, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8], \n [8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8], \n [3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8], \n [8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8], \n [3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3], \n [8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8]]\n\n",
