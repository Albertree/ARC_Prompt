For example:\nA3: To remove the rows and columns that do not contain the number 8, we can create a new grid that only includes the rows and columns that contain the number 8. This can be done by iterating over the rows and columns of the original grid and checking if the number 8 is in the row or column. If it is, we add the row or column to the new grid. For example:\nA4: To create a new grid that only contains the identified sequences from Q2, we can iterate over the rows of the original grid and for each row, create a new row that only includes the identified sequence. We then add this new row to the new grid. This can be done using nested for loops and if statements in Python. For example:\nA5: To remove any rows in the new grid that are entirely filled with 0s, we can iterate over the rows in the new grid and check if all the elements in the row are 0. If they are, we remove the row from the grid. This can be done using a for loop and the 'all' function in Python. For example:\nA6: To remove any columns in the new grid that are entirely filled with 0s, we can iterate over the columns in the new grid and check if all the elements in the column are 0. If they are, we remove the column from the grid. This can be done using a for loop and the 'all' function in Python. However, since Python's list comprehension works with rows, we would need to transpose the grid first to work with columns. For example:\n\nQ7: Return the new grid as the output.\nA7: Once all the steps are completed, the new grid can be returned as the output. This can be done simply by returning the variable that stores the new grid. For example, if the new grid is stored in a variable called 'new_grid', we can return it by using 'return new_grid' in Python."
