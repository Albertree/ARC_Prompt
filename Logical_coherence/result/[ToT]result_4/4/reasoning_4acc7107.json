Similarly, the pattern of the number 3 is moved to the position of the number 2 while maintaining the same shape and orientation.\nA4: Applying the transformation to the quiz input grid, the positions of the number 2 will be moved to the positions of the number 3 and vice versa. The output grid will be as follows:\nA5: The output grid will be as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]]."
