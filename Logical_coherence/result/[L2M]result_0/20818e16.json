So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2], [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 8, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6], [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6], [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the different regions in the grid, where a region is a group of cells with the same color that are connected through their edges.\nA1: A1: The different regions in the grid are as follows:\n\n- Region of color 1: This is the largest region and it surrounds all other regions.\n- Region of color 2: This region is located in the center of the grid and is surrounded by the region of color 1.\n- Region of color 3: This region is located within the region of color 2.\n- Region of color 8: This region is located within the region of color 1, towards the bottom of the grid.\n- Region of color 6: This region is located within the region of color 1, towards the bottom left of the grid.\n\n\nQ2: Determine the order of the regions from top to bottom and left to right.\nA2: A2: The order of the regions from top to bottom and left to right is as follows:\n\n1.
