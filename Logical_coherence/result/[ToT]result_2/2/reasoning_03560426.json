They remain as empty spaces.\nA8: Applying the same filling pattern to the empty spaces in the quiz input grid, the empty spaces would remain as they are in the output grid.\nA9: In the quiz input grid, the remaining zeros are in the positions where there are no unique numbers. These zeros remain as they are in the output grid.\nA10: In the examples, the zeros that are not replaced by unique numbers remain as zeros in the output grid. They are not changed or filled with any other numbers.\nA11: Applying the same treatment to the zeros in the quiz input grid, the zeros would remain as they are in the output grid.\n\nFinal Answer:\n[[7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
