                "A1: The pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid seems to be that each cell in the output grid corresponds to a 5x5 sub-grid in the input grid. The value of each cell in the output grid is the most frequent non-zero value in the corresponding 5x5 sub-grid in the input grid. If there is a tie for the most frequent value, the larger value is chosen.\nA2: The input grid, which is a 20x20 grid, is divided into 16 equal parts to form the output grid. Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a 5x5 sub-grid in the input grid. The top left cell in the output grid corresponds to the top left 5x5 sub-grid in the input grid, the top right cell in the output grid corresponds to the top right 5x5 sub-grid in the input grid, and so on.\nA3: The color of each cell in the output grid is determined by the most frequent non-zero color in the corresponding 5x5 sub-grid in the input grid. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, the color with the larger value is chosen. This means that the color of each cell in the output grid is influenced by the colors in the corresponding section of the input grid.\nA4: The rule for transforming the colors in the input grid to the colors in the output grid is as follows: For each cell in the output grid, look at the corresponding 5x5 sub-grid in the input grid. Count the frequency of each non-zero color in this sub-grid. The color of the cell in the output grid is the most frequent non-zero color in the sub-grid. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, the color with the larger value is chosen.\nA5: Applying the rules identified in Q1-Q4 to the input grid in the quiz, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[9, 9, 8, 9], [9, 9, 4, 9], [9, 9, 0, 9], [8, 9, 0, 8]]"
