So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2,

pattern of the number 2 in the input grid.\nA1: The pattern of the number 2 in the input grid is that it forms a square or rectangle shape in each quadrant of the grid. The squares or rectangles are formed by the number 2 being placed at the corners and the sides, with the center being empty or filled with zeros. The squares or rectangles are separated by rows and columns filled with zeros.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of the number 3 in the input grid.\nA2: A2: The pattern of the number 3 in the input grid is that it forms a solid square or rectangle in the middle of the grid. This square or rectangle is surrounded by rows and columns filled with zeros.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the pattern of the number 0 in the input grid.\nA3: A3: The pattern of the number 0 in the input grid is that it fills the spaces within the squares or rectangles formed by the number 2, and it also forms rows and columns that separate the squares or rectangles. In addition, it surrounds the solid square or rectangle formed by the number 3.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the positions where the number 2 is surrounded by 0s in the input grid.\nA4: A4: The number 2 is surrounded by 0s in the input grid at the corners of the squares or rectangles it forms. For example, in the first quadrant of the grid, the number 2 at the first row and first column, first row and fourth column, fourth row and first column, and fourth row and fourth column are all surrounded by 0s. This pattern repeats in each quadrant of the grid.\n\n\nQ5: Replace the number 2 surrounded by 0s with the number 8 in the output grid.\nA5: A5: The number 2 surrounded by 0s in the output grid should be replaced with the number 8. This means that the corners of the squares or rectangles formed by the number 2 in each quadrant of the grid should be replaced with the number 8. The rest of the grid should remain the same as the input grid.\n\n\nQ6: Identify the positions where the number 2 is not surrounded by 0s in the input grid.\nA6: A6: The number 2 is not surrounded by 0s in the input grid at the sides of the squares or rectangles it forms. For example, in the first quadrant of the grid, the number 2 at the first row and second and third columns, second and third rows and first and fourth columns, and fourth row and second and third columns are all not surrounded by 0s. This pattern repeats in each quadrant of the grid.\n\n\nQ7: Keep the number 2 not surrounded by 0s as it is in the output grid.\nA7: A7: Yes, the number 2 that is not surrounded by 0s in the input grid should remain as it is in the output grid. This means that the sides of the squares or rectangles formed by the number 2 in each quadrant of the grid should remain as the number 2. The rest of the grid should follow the pattern identified in the previous steps.\n\n\nQ8: Keep the number 3 as it is in the output grid.\nA8: A8: Yes, the number 3 in the input grid should remain as it is in the output grid. This means that the solid square or rectangle formed by the number 3 in the middle of the grid should remain as the number 3. The rest of the grid should follow the pattern identified in the previous steps.\n\n\nQ9: Keep the number 0 as it is in the output grid.\nA9: A9: Yes, the number 0 in the input grid should remain as it is in the output grid. This means that the spaces within the squares or rectangles formed by the number 2, the rows and columns that separate the squares or rectangles, and the area surrounding the solid square or rectangle formed by the number 3 should all remain as the number 0. The rest of the grid should follow the pattern identified in the previous steps.\n\n",
