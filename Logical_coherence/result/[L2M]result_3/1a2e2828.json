So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[6]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [1, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1], [1, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1], [1, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1], [0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[6]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1]].\n\nExample 5\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 1, 0], [3, 3, 3], [0, 1, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the unique number that is present in every row of the input grid.\nA1: The unique number that is present in every row of the input grid is 7.\n\n\nQ2: Check if this unique number is present in the same column in every row.\nA2: A2: Yes, the unique number 7 is present in the same column in every row.\n\n\nQ3: If the conditions in Q1 and Q2 are met, output this unique number as a single element in the output grid.\nA3: A3: Given the conditions in Q1 and Q2 are met, the output grid will be [[7]].\n\n",
