So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[2, 0], [0, 3]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 3], [0, 2]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 5, 5, 8, 8, 4, 4, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 5, 5, 8, 8, 4, 4, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[5, 4], [3, 0]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the different colors in the grid other than 0 and 8.\nA1: The different colors in the grid other than 0 and 8 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n\nQ2: Count the number of cells for each color identified in Q1.\nA2: A2: The number of cells for each color identified in Q1 are as follows: \n- Color 1: 4 cells\n- Color 2: 4 cells\n- Color 3: 4 cells\n- Color 6: 4 cells\n\n\nQ3: Arrange the colors and their counts in pairs, with the color as the first element and the count as the second.\nA3: A3: The colors and their counts arranged in pairs are as follows: \n- Pair 1: [2, 4]\n- Pair 2: [6, 4]\n- Pair 3: [1, 4]\n- Pair 4: [3, 4] \n\n\nQ4: Arrange these pairs in a 2x2 grid, with the first row containing the first two pairs and the second row containing the last two pairs.\nA4: The pairs arranged in a 2x2 grid are as follows: \n[[2, 4], [6, 4]], \n[[1, 4], [3, 4]]\n\n\nQ4: Sort the pairs in ascending order of the color.\nA4: A4: The pairs sorted in ascending order of the color are as follows: \n[[1, 4], [2, 4]], \n[[3, 4], [6, 4]]\n\n\nQ5: Convert the sorted pairs into a 2D grid, with each pair forming a row, the color as the first column, and the count as the second column.\nA5: A5: The sorted pairs converted into a 2D grid are as follows: \n[[1, 4], \n [2, 4], \n [3, 4], \n [6, 4]]\n\n",
