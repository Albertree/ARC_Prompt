If all four neighbors are '2', then the cell is surrounded by '2' on all four sides.\nA2: To replace the identified cells from Q1 with '8' if they are in the upper half of the grid and with '4' if they are in the lower half of the grid, we can use the row index of each cell. If the row index is less than the total number of rows divided by 2, the cell is in the upper half of the grid. Otherwise, it is in the lower half. We can then replace the cell value accordingly.\n\nQ3: Apply the rules from Q1 and Q2 to the input grid to get the output grid.\nA3: Applying the rules from Q1 and Q2 to the input grid, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
