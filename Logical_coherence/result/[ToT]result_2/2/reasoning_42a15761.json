If a 2 in the current row is in the same position as a 0 in the previous row, it is replaced by a 0. Conversely, if a 0 in the current row is in the same position as a 2 in the previous row, it is replaced by a 2. This rule is applied to each row in turn, starting from the second row.\nA4: Applying the rule to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]]"
