So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 0, 6, 0, 0], [5, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[5, 0, 6, 0, 0], [5, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [5, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0], [5, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [5, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0], [5, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]].\n\nExample 5\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[5, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the input grid that is repeated in the output grid.\nA1: The pattern in the input grid that is repeated in the output grid is that the non-zero elements in the middle of the grid are mirrored vertically downwards. The mirrored elements are placed in the same columns as the original elements, starting from the row immediately below the last non-zero row of the input grid. The number of times the elements are mirrored depends on the number of zero rows below the last non-zero row in the input grid.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the changes that occur from the input grid to the output grid.\nA2: A2: The changes that occur from the input grid to the output grid are that the non-zero elements in the middle of the grid are duplicated and placed in the same columns, starting from the row immediately below the last non-zero row of the input grid. The number of times the elements are duplicated depends on the number of zero rows below the last non-zero row in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains the same.\n\nQ3: What is the output grid for the quiz?\nA3: The output grid for the quiz is:\n[[5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Determine the rule for when and where these changes occur.\nA3: A3: The rule for when and where these changes occur is as follows: \n1. Identify the non-zero elements in the middle of the grid. \n2. Mirror these elements vertically downwards, placing them in the same columns as the original elements. \n3. Start placing the mirrored elements from the row immediately below the last non-zero row of the input grid. \n4. The number of times the elements are mirrored depends on the number of zero rows below the last non-zero row in the input grid. \n5. If there are no zero rows below the last non-zero row, no changes occur. \n6. The rest of the grid remains the same.\n\n\nQ4: Apply this rule to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA4: A4: To apply this rule to the input grid of the quiz, we first identify the non-zero elements in the middle of the grid, which are [4, 4, 4], [8], [6], and [2, 2]. We then mirror these elements vertically downwards, placing them in the same columns as the original elements. We start placing the mirrored elements from the row immediately below the last non-zero row of the input grid, which is the fifth row. The number of times the elements are mirrored depends on the number of zero rows below the last non-zero row in the input grid, which is six. Therefore, the output grid is:\n\n[[5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n",
