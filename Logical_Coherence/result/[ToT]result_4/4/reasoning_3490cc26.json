If the pattern of the number 8 is a block, the number 7 should be placed in the cells that form a block around the number 8. If the pattern of the number 8 is a line, the number 7 should be placed in the cells that form a line around the number 8. If the pattern of the number 2 is a block, the number 7 should be placed in the cells that form a block around the number 2. If the pattern of the number 2 is a line, the number 7 should be placed in the cells that form a line around the number 2.\nA6: The number 7 can be filled in the locations identified in Q5 by iterating over each cell in the grid and checking if its coordinates match any of the stored coordinates. If they do, the value of the cell is set to 7. This generates the output grid."
