                    "A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid seems to be related to the number of '8's in each row and column. If we look closely, we can see that the output grid is a 5x4 grid where each cell corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input grid. The value in each cell of the output grid is determined by the number of '8's in the corresponding 2x2 block in the input grid. If there are no '8's, the cell is '0'. If there is one '8', the cell is '2'. If there are two '8's, the cell is '2'. If there are three '8's, the cell is '2'. If there are four '8's, the cell is '2'. \nA2: The reduction is achieved by dividing the input grid into 2x2 blocks and representing each block by a single cell in the output grid. The value in the output cell is determined by the number of '8's in the corresponding 2x2 block in the input grid.\nA3: The colors in the input grid are mapped to the colors in the output grid based on the number of '8's in each 2x2 block. If there are no '8's, the cell is '0'. If there is at least one '8', the cell is '2'. The colors '4' and '5' in the input grid do not seem to have any effect on the output grid.\nA4: Each quadrant in the output grid corresponds to a quadrant in the input grid. Specifically, each cell in the output grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the same relative position in the input grid. For example, the top left cell in the output grid corresponds to the top left 2x2 block in the input grid, the top right cell in the output grid corresponds to the top right 2x2 block in the input grid, and so on.\nA5: The rule for transforming the colors in each quadrant of the input grid to the corresponding quadrant in the output grid is as follows: For each 2x2 block in the input grid, count the number of '8's. If there are no '8's, the corresponding cell in the output grid is '0'. If there is at least one '8', the corresponding cell in the output grid is '2'.
