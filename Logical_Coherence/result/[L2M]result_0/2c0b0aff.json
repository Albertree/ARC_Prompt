So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: The pattern of the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples is as follows:\n\n1. The transformation only considers the non-zero elements in the input grid. \n\n2. The transformation extracts a sub-grid from the input grid. The sub-grid is defined by the rectangle that contains all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n\n3. The transformation then rotates this sub-grid 90 degrees clockwise to get the output grid. \n\n4. The transformation also seems to ignore rows and columns that are entirely filled with zeros in the input grid. \n\n5. The transformation does not change the values of the elements, only their positions. \n\nSo, the transformation involves identifying the sub-grid containing all non-zero elements, rotating this sub-grid, and ignoring zero-filled rows and columns.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a smaller section of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a smaller section of the input grid. This is because the transformation only considers the sub-grid that contains all non-zero elements in the input grid. Any rows or columns that are entirely filled with zeros are ignored in the transformation, resulting in a smaller output grid.\n\n\nQ3: Notice that the output grid only includes rows where the number 3 is present.\nA3: A3: No, that's not correct. The output grid includes rows where the number 3 is present, but it also includes rows with the number 8. The output grid is not determined by the presence of the number 3. It is determined by the sub-grid that contains all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the output grid only includes columns where the number 3 is present.\nA4: A4: No, that's not correct. The output grid includes columns where the number 3 is present, but it also includes columns with the number 8. The output grid is not determined by the presence of the number 3. It is determined by the sub-grid that contains all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the same transformation to the quiz input grid by selecting the rows and columns identified in Q3 and Q4.\nA5: A5: As mentioned in the previous answers, the transformation does not depend on the presence of the number 3. Instead, it involves identifying the sub-grid that contains all non-zero elements in the input grid and rotating this sub-grid 90 degrees clockwise. \n\nApplying this transformation to the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n\n",
