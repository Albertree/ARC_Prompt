It also forms a solid block at the top and bottom of the grid.\nA4: The patterns of the numbers 2, 3, and 0 in the input grid seem to be related in a way that they form a larger pattern or image. The number 2 forms the shape of the digit \"8\", the number 3 forms a solid block, and the number 0 forms the empty spaces within and around these patterns. The block of 3s is always located below the \"8\" shape formed by the 2s, and the 0s fill in the rest of the grid.\nA5: In the output grid, the 2s that are located at the corners of the \"8\" shape in the input grid are changed to 8s. This includes the 2s that are located at the top left, top right, middle left, middle right, bottom left, and bottom right of the \"8\" shape. The rest of the 2s, 3s, and 0s remain the same. The block of 3s in the input grid is also removed in the output grid.\nA6: The rule for changing 2s to 8s in the input grid is as follows: If a 2 is at the corner of the \"8\" shape formed by 2s, it is changed to an 8 in the output grid. This includes the 2s that are located at the top left, top right, middle left, middle right, bottom left, and bottom right of the \"8\" shape. The rest of the 2s remain the same.\nA7: Applying the rule identified in Q6 to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be as follows:\n\n[[8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]]"
