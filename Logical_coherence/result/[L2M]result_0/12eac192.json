    "prompt": "\nDo you know ARC problem?\n\nIt is similary below.\n\n=========\nExample 1\n\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\n=========\n\nYou can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.\nIn above case, you can inference like below.\n\nIn example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1], [0, 7, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 5, 1, 7, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 8, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0], [3, 3, 3, 7, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 8, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 0, 8, 8]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[1, 7, 7, 1, 0, 8, 0, 5], [1, 7, 7, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [5, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 7, 7, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3], [3, 7, 7, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[1, 0, 5], [1, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 5, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 5], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1], [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 7]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the cells in the grid that have a value of 1 and are surrounded by 0s on all four sides (up, down, left, right).\nA1: A1: The cells that have a value of 1 and are surrounded by 0s on all four sides are located at the following positions: (1,1), (1,6), (3,1), (3,5), (4,1), (4,6), (6,2), (6,6), (7,2), (7,5).\n\n\nQ2: Change the value of these identified cells to 3.\nA2: A2: The output grid after changing the value of the identified cells to 3 would be:\n\n[[0, 5, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0], \n [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n [1, 3, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 3], \n [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7], \n [1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7], \n [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 7]]\n\n",
