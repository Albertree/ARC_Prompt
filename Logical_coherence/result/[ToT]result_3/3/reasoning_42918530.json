The rectangles themselves contain a pattern where the middle row or column is filled with the same color, while the rest of the rectangle has a border of the same color and zeros in the middle.\nA2: The changes between the input and output grids in the examples are that the middle row or column of each rectangle is filled with the same color as the border, creating a cross or plus sign shape within each rectangle. The rest of the grid remains the same.\nA3: The rule for changing the numbers in the input grid to the output grid is to fill the middle row and column of each rectangle with the same color as the border, creating a cross or plus sign shape within each rectangle. The rest of the grid remains the same.\nA4: Applying the rule to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
