So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[9, 8, 8, 8, 9], [8, 8, 2, 8, 8], [8, 2, 2, 2, 8], [8, 8, 2, 8, 8], [9, 8, 8, 8, 9]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 2, 8, 9, 2], [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 9, 2, 8, 9, 2], [8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 9, 2, 8, 9, 2], [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 9, 2, 8, 9, 2], [9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 2, 8, 9, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 8, 9, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 9, 2], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 3, 3, 3, 2], [3, 3, 5, 3, 3], [3, 5, 5, 5, 3], [3, 3, 5, 3, 3], [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5], [3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5], [3, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5], [3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5], [2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 3, 2, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 2, 5], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples is as follows:\n\n1. The original input grid is copied to the top left corner of the output grid.\n2. The center row of the input grid is copied to the right of the original grid in the output grid.\n3. The center column of the input grid is copied to the bottom of the original grid in the output grid.\n4. The center cell of the input grid is copied to the bottom right corner of the output grid.\n5. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with the value of the center cell of the input grid.\n\nThis pattern is consistent across both examples.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 10x10 grid, which is twice the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 10x10 grid, which is twice the size of the input grid. This is because the pattern involves copying the input grid and its center row and column to create a larger grid. The remaining cells are then filled with the value of the center cell of the input grid.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]],\nthen the output grid would be \n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the first half of the output grid is a copy of the input grid with the center number replaced by the number in the second row and second column of the input grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. The first half of the output grid is indeed a copy of the input grid, but with the center number replaced by the number in the second row and second column of the input grid. This is part of the pattern identified in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: The second half of the output grid is a new 5x5 grid appended to the first half.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The second half of the output grid is a new 5x5 grid that is appended to the first half. This new grid is created by copying the center row and column of the input grid and filling the remaining cells with the value of the center cell of the input grid. This is consistent with the pattern identified in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply these observations to the quiz input grid to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying these observations to the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].\n\nThis output grid is generated by following the pattern identified in the examples. The original input grid is copied to the top left corner of the output grid, the center row of the input grid is copied to the right of the original grid in the output grid, the center column of the input grid is copied to the bottom of the original grid in the output grid, the center cell of the input grid is copied to the bottom right corner of the output grid, and the remaining cells in the output grid are filled with the value of the center cell of the input grid.\n\n",
