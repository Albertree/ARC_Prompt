The grid is divided into two halves vertically by a column containing the number 2. \n\n2. The cells in the left half of the grid are transformed into 1 if the original number is 7, and 0 if the original number is 0.\n\n3. The cells in the right half of the grid are transformed into 1 if the original number is 7, and 0 if the original number is 0.\n\n4. The column containing the number 2 is removed in the output grid.\n\nSo, the transformation rule can be summarized as: if the cell value is 7, change it to 1, if the cell value is 0, change it to 0, and remove the column containing the number 2.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is always smaller than the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always smaller than the input grid. This is because the column containing the number 2 in the input grid is removed in the transformation process, reducing the width of the grid by one column.\n\n\nQ3: Notice that the output grid is always filled with 1s and 0s.\nA3: A3: Yes, the output grid is always filled with 1s and 0s. This is because the transformation rule changes all the 7s in the input grid to 1s and all the 0s in the input grid remain as 0s. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],\nthen the output grid will be \n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]].\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the 7th column in the input grid always contains the number 2.\nA4: A4: Yes, the 7th column in the input grid always contains the number 2. This column acts as a divider between the left and right halves of the grid and is removed in the transformation process.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the rules identified in Q1-Q4 to transform the input grid of the quiz into the output grid.\nA5: A5: To transform the input grid of the quiz into the output grid, we follow the rules identified in Q1-Q4:\n\n1. Identify the column containing the number 2. This column divides the grid into two halves.\n\n2. For the cells in the left half of the grid, if the original number is 7, change it to 1. If the original number is 0, keep it as 0.\n\n3. Do the same for the cells in the right half of the grid.\n\n4. Remove the column containing the number 2.\n\nSo, if the input grid is \n[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],\nthen the output grid will be \n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]].\n\n",
