In the fifth row, the sequence is interrupted after the 9th number, and the zeros continue for 7 numbers. The pattern of zeros continues in this way for several rows.\nA3: The pattern of numbers that should replace the zeros is the continuation of the sequence of numbers before the zeros. For example, if the sequence is interrupted after the number 7, the zeros should be replaced with the sequence starting from 9, then 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. The sequence should continue in this way until the end of the row.\nA4: To replace the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers, we need to identify the last number before the zeros and continue the sequence from there. For example, in the fourth row, the sequence is interrupted after the number 7, so the zeros should be replaced with the sequence starting from 9, then 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. The same process should be applied to all rows where the sequence is interrupted by zeros.\nA5: After replacing the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers, we need to ensure that the sequence continues seamlessly. This means that the sequence should not restart from 1 after the replacement, but should continue from the last number before the zeros. For example, if the sequence was interrupted after the number 7, the sequence after the replacement should continue from 9, then 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. This ensures that the pattern of numbers in the grid is consistent and uninterrupted."

                "A1: The pattern of numbers in the input grid is a sequence of numbers from 1 to 9, repeating in a certain pattern. The sequence starts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, then 2, 4, 6, 8, and then repeats. This sequence is repeated in each row of the grid, with some rows having a section of zeros in the middle. The first two rows and the last row of the grid are filled with 1s, and the third row is filled with 4s.\nA2: The pattern is interrupted by zeros in several rows of the grid. These interruptions occur in different positions and lengths in each row. For example, in the fourth row, the sequence is interrupted after the 10th number, and the zeros continue for 7 numbers.
