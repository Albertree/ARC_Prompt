So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 0, 6, 6], [0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the input grids of the examples.\nA1: The pattern in the input grids of the examples is that the grids are divided into three sections. The first section contains a pattern of 2s, the second section contains a pattern of 7s, and the third section contains a pattern of 6s. The patterns of 2s and 6s are not always the same, but they are always separated by a row of 7s.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern in the output grids of the examples.\nA2: A2: The pattern in the output grids of the examples is that the grids are always 6 rows by 4 columns. The number 8 appears in the output grids in a pattern that mirrors the pattern of 2s in the corresponding input grid. The rest of the cells in the output grids are filled with 0s.\n\n\nQ3: How does the pattern in the input grids relate to the pattern in the output grids?.\nA3: A3: The pattern in the input grids relates to the pattern in the output grids in that the pattern of 2s in the input grid is mirrored and replaced with 8s in the output grid. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s. The row of 7s in the input grid seems to act as a separator and does not appear in the output grid. The pattern of 6s in the input grid also does not appear in the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the sections of the input grid in the quiz that match the pattern identified in Q1.\nA4: A4: The sections of the input grid in the quiz that match the pattern identified in Q1 are as follows: The first section contains a pattern of 2s, the second section contains a pattern of 7s, and the third section contains a pattern of 6s. The patterns of 2s and 6s are not the same, but they are always separated by a row of 7s.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the transformation identified in Q3 to the sections identified in Q4 to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the transformation identified in Q3 to the sections identified in Q4, we replace the pattern of 2s in the input grid with 8s in the output grid and fill the rest of the cells with 0s. The output grid is as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8]]\n\n",
