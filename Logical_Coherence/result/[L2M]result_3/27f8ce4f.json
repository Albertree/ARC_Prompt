The input grid is a 3x3 matrix. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. The input grid is replicated three times in the output grid. The first replication is placed in the top left corner of the output grid, the second replication is placed in the middle of the output grid, and the third replication is placed in the bottom left corner of the output grid.\n\n3. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\n4. The placement of the replicated input grids in the output grid is shifted down by one row for each subsequent replication. For example, in Example 1, the first input grid starts at row 1, the second at row 4, and the third at row 7. In Example 2, the first input grid starts at row 1, the second at row 5, and the third at row 7. In Example 3, the first input grid starts at row 3, the second at row 5, and the third at row 7. In Example 4, the first input grid starts at row 4, the second at row 6, and the third at row 8.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the input grid is repeated three times in the output grid, once in the top left, once in the middle, and once in the bottom left.\nA2: A2: Yes, that's correct. The input grid is indeed repeated three times in the output grid. The first repetition is placed in the top left corner, the second repetition is placed in the middle, and the third repetition is placed in the bottom left corner. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[9, 6, 7], [8, 7, 7], [2, 8, 7]],\nthen the output grid would be\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 6, 7, 9, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0], [8, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [2, 8, 7, 2, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the size of the input grid and create an output grid of three times the size.\nA3: A3: The input grid is a 3x3 matrix. To create an output grid of three times the size, we would need to create a 9x9 matrix. This is because the output grid needs to accommodate three repetitions of the input grid, each of which is a 3x3 matrix. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\n\nQ4: Place the input grid in the top left, middle, and bottom left positions of the output grid.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The input grid is placed in the top left, middle, and bottom left positions of the output grid. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with zeros. The placement of the input grid in the output grid is shifted down by one row for each subsequent placement. For example, in the quiz, the first input grid starts at row 4, the second at row 6, and the third at row 8.\n\n\nQ5: Fill the remaining spaces in the output grid with zeros.\nA5: A5: Yes, that's correct. After placing the input grid in the top left, middle, and bottom left positions of the output grid, the remaining spaces in the output grid are filled with zeros. This is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples.\n\n",
