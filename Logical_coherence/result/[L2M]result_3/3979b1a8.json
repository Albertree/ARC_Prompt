The outermost layer of the square is one color, the next layer is another color, and the center of the square is a third color. The square is symmetrical along both the vertical and horizontal axes.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA2: A2: The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves two steps. First, the input grid is duplicated and placed to the right of the original grid. The colors of the duplicated grid are the same as the original, but the center color is replaced with the color of the outermost layer of the original grid. Second, the input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and placed below the original and duplicated grids. The colors of the rotated grid are the same as the original, but the center color is replaced with the color of the outermost layer of the original grid, and the outermost layer color is replaced with the center color of the original grid.\n\n\nQ3: Apply the transformation identified in Q2 to the input grid in the quiz.\nA3: A3: If we apply the transformation to the input grid in the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]]\n\n\nQ4: Create the mirrored version of the original square in the top right corner of the output grid.\nA4: A4: The mirrored version of the original square in the top right corner of the output grid would look like this:\n\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]]\n\n\nQ5: Create the mirrored version of the top half of the grid in the bottom half, but with the numbers in the corners and center of the squares swapped.\nA5: A5: The mirrored version of the top half of the grid in the bottom half, with the numbers in the corners and center of the squares swapped, would look like this:\n\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]]\n\n\nQ6: Verify that the output grid matches the pattern in the examples.\nA6: A6: Yes, the output grid matches the pattern in the examples. The original square is mirrored to the right with the center color replaced with the outermost color. Then, the original square is mirrored to the bottom with a 90-degree clockwise rotation, and the center and outermost colors are swapped. This pattern is consistent with the transformations in the examples.\n\n",
