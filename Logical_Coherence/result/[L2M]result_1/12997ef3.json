The triangle is located at the top left corner of the grid. The base of the triangle is along the left edge of the grid and the height of the triangle is along the top edge of the grid. The triangle is made up of 1s and the rest of the grid is filled with 0s.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the input grid.\nA2: A2: The pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the input grid is that they are located in a single row towards the bottom of the grid. They are evenly spaced apart with 0s in between and on either side. The order from left to right is 2, 8, 3, 6.\n\n\nQ3: Map the pattern of 1s to the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8.\nA3: A3: The pattern of 1s is mapped to the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 by replacing each row of 1s with a row of 2s, 8s, 3s, and 6s. The number of 1s in each row determines the number of 2s, 8s, 3s, and 6s in the corresponding row. The pattern of 1s is mirrored along the vertical axis and then each 1 is replaced with a 2, 8, 3, or 6 in the order they appear in the input grid. The output grid is smaller than the input grid and only contains the rows and columns where the 1s and 2, 8, 3, 6 were located.\n\nSo, the output grids are like that\n[[0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0], [2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0], [2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0]].\n\n\nQ4: Generate the output grid based on the mapping from Q3.\nA4: A4: Based on the mapping from Q3, the output grid is generated by replacing each row of 1s with a row of 2s, 8s, 3s, and 6s. The number of 1s in each row determines the number of 2s, 8s, 3s, and 6s in the corresponding row. The pattern of 1s is mirrored along the vertical axis and then each 1 is replaced with a 2, 8, 3, or 6 in the order they appear in the input grid. The output grid is smaller than the input grid and only contains the rows and columns where the 1s and 2, 8, 3, 6 were located. So, the output grid is as follows:\n\n[[0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0], \n [2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0], \n [2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0], \n [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0]]\n\n",
