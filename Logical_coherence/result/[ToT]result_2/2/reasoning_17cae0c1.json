From the examples, it seems that the section filled with 0s is transformed to 4s in the first example, 9s in the second example, 1s in the third example, and 4s in the fourth example. The section filled with 5s is transformed to 3s in the first example, 1s in the second example, 6s in the third example, and 3s in the fourth example.",

The sections are separated by the number 5.\nA2: Yes, the transformation rules are as follows: the first three columns are transformed to a specific number, the middle three columns to another number, and the last three columns to a third number. The specific numbers seem to be determined by the position of the number 5 in the input grid. If the number 5 is in the first three columns, the output is 3, 4, 9. If the number 5 is in the middle three columns, the output is 9, 1, 4. If the number 5 is in the last three columns, the output is 6, 3, 1. If the number 5 is in the first and last three columns, the output is 4, 6, 3.\nA3: Yes, the transformation for each section seems to be determined by the position of the number 5 in the input grid. If the number 5 is in the first three columns, the section filled with 0s is transformed to 4s and the section filled with 5s is transformed to 3s.

If the number 5 is in the last three columns, the middle section is transformed to 3s. If the number 5 is in the first and last three columns, the middle section is transformed to 6s.\nA5: The input grid of the quiz is [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].
