The size of the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. If the input grid is of size m x n, the output grid is of size 3m x 3n.\n\n2. Each cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. For example, if a cell in the input grid at position (i, j) has a value of v, then the cells in the output grid at positions (3i, 3j), (3i+1, 3j+1), and (3i+2, 3j+2) will have a value of v.\n\n3. For the cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell in the input grid, their value is determined by the following rule: if the cell is in an even row and an even column, its value is 2; otherwise, its value is 0. The rows and columns are 0-indexed, meaning the first row and the first column are considered row 0 and column 0, respectively.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This means that if the input grid is of size m x n, the output grid will be of size 3m x 3n. This is a consistent pattern observed in all the examples provided.\n\n\nQ3: Observe that every cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. Each cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. For example, if a cell in the input grid at position (i, j) has a value of v, then the cells in the output grid at positions (3i, 3j), (3i+1, 3j+1), and (3i+2, 3j+2) will have a value of v. This is a consistent pattern observed in all the examples provided.\n\nQ4: What is the rule for the cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell in the input grid?\nA4: The rule for the cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell in the input grid is as follows: if the cell is in an even row and an even column, its value is 2; otherwise, its value is 0. The rows and columns are 0-indexed, meaning the first row and the first column are considered row 0 and column 0, respectively.\n\nQ5: What is the output grid for the quiz input?\nA5: The output grid for the quiz input is as follows:\n\n[[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the first cell of every three cells in the output grid, both in rows and columns, is replaced by 2 if it was 0 in the input grid.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. In the output grid, the first cell of every three cells, both in rows and columns, is replaced by 2 if it was 0 in the input grid. This is a consistent pattern observed in all the examples provided. This pattern is part of the rule for determining the value of cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell in the input grid. Specifically, if the cell is in an even row and an even column, its value is 2; otherwise, its value is 0.\n\n\nQ5: Apply these transformations to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the transformations to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n",
