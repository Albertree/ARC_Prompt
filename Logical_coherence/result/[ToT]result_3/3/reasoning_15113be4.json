If all four neighbors are 4, then the cell is surrounded by 4s. \nA2: To check if the identified cells from Q1 contain the number 1, we can simply check the value of the cell. If the value is 1, then it contains the number 1.\nA3: If the cell contains the number 1, we can simply assign the value 3 to that cell in the grid. This will change the cell's value from 1 to 3.\nA4: To identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 4s on three sides and 0 on one side, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its four neighbors (top, bottom, left, and right). If three neighbors are 4 and one neighbor is 0, then the cell is surrounded by 4s on three sides and 0 on one side.\nA5: To check if the identified cells from Q4 contain the number 1, we can simply check the value of the cell. If the value is 1, then it contains the number 1.\nA6: If the cell contains the number 1, we can simply assign the value 6 to that cell in the grid.
