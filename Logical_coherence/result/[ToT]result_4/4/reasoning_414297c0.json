In the cross pattern, 3 should be in the middle of the cross, 7 should be at the top, and 8 should be at the bottom.\nA5: The output grid should look like this:\n\n[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]\n\nThe special numbers are placed at the predicted positions and the rest of the grid is filled with 1s."
