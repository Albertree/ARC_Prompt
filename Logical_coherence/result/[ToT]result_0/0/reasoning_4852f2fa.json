                "A1: The pattern of 8s in the input grid forms a shape that resembles the digit '8'. It is located in the top right corner of the grid.\nA2: The number 4 appears twice in the input grid. The first 4 is located in the first column of the fifth row, and the second 4 is located in the fourth column of the eighth row.\nA3: The pattern of 8s and the position of 4s in the input grid seem to be independent of each other. The pattern of 8s does not change based on the position of the 4s. However, the presence of 4s might indicate the number of times the pattern of 8s should be repeated in the output grid.\nA4: Based on the relationship identified in Q3, the pattern of 8s in the output grid should be the same as the pattern of 8s in the input grid, repeated twice horizontally. This is because there are two 4s in the input grid.\nA5: The size of the output grid should be 3 rows by 12 columns. This is because the pattern of 8s in the input grid is 3 rows by 3 columns, and it should be repeated twice horizontally in the output grid due to the presence of two 4s in the input grid.\nA6: The output grid should be as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]]"
