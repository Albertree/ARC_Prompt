                "A1: The pattern of the color change in the examples is that the color 8 changes to a different color in each example. The new color seems to be determined by the shape of the color 8 in the input grid. For example, in the first example, the color 8 changes to color 2, in the second example it changes to color 3, in the third example it changes to color 2, in the fourth example it changes to color 7, and in the fifth example it changes to color 3. \nA2: The colored cells in the input grid form a specific pattern that seems to be a combination of lines and shapes. The pattern is not consistent across all examples, but in each case, the colored cells form a distinct shape or pattern. For example, in the first example, the colored cells form a shape that resembles a butterfly or a bow tie. In the second example, the colored cells form a pattern that resembles a grid or a checkerboard. In the third example, the colored cells form a pattern that resembles a cross or a plus sign. In the fourth example, the colored cells form a pattern that resembles a star or a flower. In the fifth example, the colored cells form a pattern that resembles a diamond or a square. \nA3: In the given examples, the color 1 does not seem to affect the transformation. The color 1 is present in the input grid in all examples, but it does not appear in the output grid. This suggests that the color 1 does not play a role in the transformation process. The transformation seems to be solely based on the pattern or shape of the color 8 in the input grid. \nA4: Applying the identified color change to the input grid of the quiz, the color 8 should change to a different color while maintaining the identified shape or pattern. The new color seems to be determined by the shape of the color 8 in the input grid. In this case, the color 8 forms a pattern that resembles a cross or a plus sign, similar to the third example. Therefore, the color 8 should change to color 2, the same color change as in the third example. The output grid should be:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
