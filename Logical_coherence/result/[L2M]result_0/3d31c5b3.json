Each color forms a distinct shape or pattern, and these patterns are separated by rows of zeros. The colors are not mixed within a single pattern, and each pattern spans multiple rows. The patterns are not necessarily symmetrical or regular, but they are contiguous, meaning that all cells of the same color are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern in the output grids.\nA2: A2: The pattern in the output grids is that the distinct color patterns from the input grids are compressed into a single row each, maintaining the order from top to bottom. The colors from the input grid are arranged in the same order in the output grid, but now each color occupies only one row. The number of cells of each color in the output grid is the same as in the input grid. The colors are arranged from left to right in the order they appear from top to bottom in the input grid. The zeros are removed in the output grid.\n\n\nQ3: Determine how the patterns from the input grid are combined in the output grid.\nA3: A3: The patterns from the input grid are combined in the output grid by compressing each distinct color pattern into a single row. The order of the colors in the output grid is the same as the order from top to bottom in the input grid. The number of cells of each color in the output grid is the same as in the input grid. The zeros are removed in the output grid. The colors are arranged from left to right in the order they appear from top to bottom in the input grid.\n\nQuiz Answer: \n[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]\n\n\nQ4: Determine how to apply this pattern combination to the quiz input grid.\nA4: A4: To apply this pattern combination to the quiz input grid, we first identify the distinct color patterns in the input grid. We see that there are three distinct color patterns: 5, 4, and 2. We ignore the zeros and the color 8 as they do not form a distinct pattern. We then compress each color pattern into a single row in the output grid. The order of the colors in the output grid is the same as the order from top to bottom in the input grid. The number of cells of each color in the output grid is the same as in the input grid. The colors are arranged from left to right in the order they appear from top to bottom in the input grid. Therefore, the output grid for the quiz input grid is [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]].\n\n",
