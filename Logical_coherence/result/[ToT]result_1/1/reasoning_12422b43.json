The position of the mirrored elements in the output grid is directly below the original elements, maintaining the same horizontal alignment.\nA4: To mirror these elements to the corresponding positions in the bottom half of the grid, we need to copy the rows with non-zero elements and place them in the bottom half of the grid, replacing the zeros. The mirrored elements should maintain the same horizontal alignment as the original elements.\nA5: To ensure that the mirrored elements maintain their original arrangement in the mirrored half, we need to copy the rows with non-zero elements exactly as they are, without changing the order or arrangement of the elements within the row. The mirrored elements should appear as a mirror image of the original elements, with the same shapes or patterns. \nA6: Applying this pattern to the input grid of the quiz, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
