These cells form separate shapes and each shape will be changed to a different color.\nA5: The color of the cells identified in Q4 can be changed according to the rules identified in Q2 as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]"
