So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[6, 2, 4, 2], [2, 2, 6, 6], [6, 4, 2, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4], [6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6], [2, 4, 2, 6, 6, 2, 4, 2], [2, 4, 2, 6, 6, 2, 4, 2], [6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6], [4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 5, 5, 5], [5, 7, 5, 7]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 7], [5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5], [9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5], [7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 7]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 3, 5, 5], [5, 8, 5, 8], [8, 8, 5, 8]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8], [8, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 8], [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5], [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5], [8, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 8], [8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 5, 7, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8, 5]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that the input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically. This means that the rows and columns of the input grid are duplicated in reverse order. For example, if the input grid is [[a, b, c, d], [e, f, g, h], [i, j, k, l]], the output grid will be [[d, c, b, a, a, b, c, d], [h, g, f, e, e, f, g, h], [l, k, j, i, i, j, k, l], [l, k, j, i, i, j, k, l], [h, g, f, e, e, f, g, h], [d, c, b, a, a, b, c, d]].\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the rows and columns of the input grid are duplicated in reverse order to create the output grid.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is [[8, 5, 7, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8, 5]], then the output grid will be [[8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5], [5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8]].\n\n\nQ3: Implement a function that mirrors the input grid horizontally.\nA3: A3: Here is a Python function that mirrors a grid horizontally:\n\n```python\ndef mirror_grid_horizontally(grid):\n    mirrored_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        mirrored_row = row[::-1]  # Reverse the order of elements in the row\n        mirrored_grid.append(mirrored_row)\n    return mirrored_grid\n```\n\nThis function takes a 2D list (grid) as input, and for each row in the grid, it reverses the order of elements in the row to create a mirrored row. It then appends this mirrored row to the mirrored grid. The function finally returns the mirrored grid.\n\n\nQ4: Implement a function that mirrors the input grid vertically.\nA4: A4: Here is a Python function that mirrors a grid vertically:\n\n```python\ndef mirror_grid_vertically(grid):\n    return grid[::-1]  # Reverse the order of rows in the grid\n```\n\nThis function takes a 2D list (grid) as input, and it reverses the order of rows in the grid to create a mirrored grid. The function finally returns the mirrored grid.\n\n\nQ5: Combine the two functions to create the final output grid.\nA5: A5: Here is a Python function that combines the two functions to create the final output grid:\n\n```python\ndef mirror_grid(grid):\n    # Mirror the grid horizontally\n    horizontal_mirror = mirror_grid_horizontally(grid)\n    # Mirror the grid vertically\n    vertical_mirror = mirror_grid_vertically(grid)\n    # Combine the two mirrored grids\n    final_grid = []\n    for i in range(len(horizontal_mirror)):\n        final_grid.append(horizontal_mirror[i] + vertical_mirror[i])\n    return final_grid\n```\n\nThis function first mirrors the input grid horizontally and vertically. It then combines the two mirrored grids by appending the elements of the vertically mirrored grid to the corresponding elements of the horizontally mirrored grid. The function finally returns the final grid.\n\n",
