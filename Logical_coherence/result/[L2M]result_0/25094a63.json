So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3,

sequence of six or more consecutive 8s, we can iterate through each row and check for the presence of this sequence. Here is a Python code snippet that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6], ...]\n\nfor i, row in enumerate(input_grid):\n    str_row = ''.join(map(str, row))\n    if '888888' in str_row:\n        print(f\"Row {i} contains a sequence of six or more consecutive 8s.\")\n```\n\nThis code converts each row to a string and then checks if the string '888888' (representing six consecutive 8s) is present in the row. If it is, it prints the row index.\n\n\nQ2: For each row identified in Q1, find the index of the first 8 in the sequence of six or more consecutive 8s.\nA2: A2: To find the index of the first 8 in the sequence of six or more consecutive 8s for each row identified in Q1, we can modify the previous code snippet to also keep track of the index. Here is a Python code snippet that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6], ...]\n\nfor i, row in enumerate(input_grid):\n    str_row = ''.join(map(str, row))\n    if '888888' in str_row:\n        index = str_row.index('888888')\n        print(f\"In row {i}, the first 8 in the sequence of six or more consecutive 8s is at index {index}.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses the `index` method of the string to find the index of the first occurrence of '888888' in the string representation of the row.\n\n\nQ3: For each row identified in Q1, find the index of the last 8 in the sequence of six or more consecutive 8s.\nA3: A3: To find the index of the last 8 in the sequence of six or more consecutive 8s for each row identified in Q1, we can modify the previous code snippet to also keep track of the index. Here is a Python code snippet that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6], ...]\n\nfor i, row in enumerate(input_grid):\n    str_row = ''.join(map(str, row))\n    if '888888' in str_row:\n        index = str_row.index('888888')\n        last_index = index + 5  # Add 5 because the sequence is 6 numbers long\n        print(f\"In row {i}, the last 8 in the sequence of six or more consecutive 8s is at index {last_index}.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses the `index` method of the string to find the index of the first occurrence of '888888' in the string representation of the row. It then adds 5 to this index to find the index of the last 8 in the sequence.\n\n\nQ4: Replace all the 8s between the indices found in Q2 and Q3 with 4s for each row identified in Q1.\nA4: A4: To replace all the 8s between the indices found in Q2 and Q3 with 4s for each row identified in Q1, we can modify the previous code snippet to also perform this replacement. Here is a Python code snippet that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6], ...]\n\nfor i, row in enumerate(input_grid):\n    str_row = ''.join(map(str, row))\n    if '888888' in str_row:\n        index = str_row.index('888888')\n        last_index = index + 5  # Add 5 because the sequence is 6 numbers long\n        row[index:last_index+1] = [4]*6  # Replace the 8s with 4s\n\nprint(input_grid)\n```\n\nThis code uses list slicing to replace the 8s with 4s in the original input grid. The `+1` in `last_index+1` is necessary because the end index in a slice is exclusive.\n\nThe output of this code will be the input grid with all the 8s in sequences of six or more consecutive 8s replaced with 4s.\n\n",
    "answer": "A4: To replace all the 8s between the indices found in Q2 and Q3 with 4s for each row identified in Q1, we can modify the previous code snippet to also perform this replacement.
