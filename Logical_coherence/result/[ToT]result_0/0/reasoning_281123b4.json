If there is a tie for the most frequent number, the larger number is chosen.\n\nThe input grid for the quiz is:\n\n[[8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 5, 0, 5, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 0, 4], \n [8, 0, 0, 8, 3, 5, 0, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4], \n [0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 5, 5, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 0, 4, 4, 0]]\n\nBy applying the rules, the output grid would be:\n\n[[8, 5, 9, 4], \n [8, 5, 9, 4], \n [8, 5, 9, 4], \n [8, 5, 9, 4]]"
