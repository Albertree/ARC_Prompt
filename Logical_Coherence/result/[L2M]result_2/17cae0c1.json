So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.\nA1: The pattern of the input grid is that it is divided into three equal parts horizontally. The first part is filled with zeros, the second part is filled with fives, and the third part is filled with zeros again. However, in each part, there is one cell that is filled with the number from the adjacent part.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of the output grid in the examples.\nA2: A2: The pattern of the output grid is that it is also divided into three equal parts horizontally. However, the numbers in the output grid are different from the input grid. The first part is filled with the number of non-zero cells in the third part of the input grid, the second part is filled with the number of non-zero cells in the first part of the input grid, and the third part is filled with the number of non-zero cells in the second part of the input grid.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the relationship between the input and output grids.\nA3: A3: The relationship between the input and output grids is that the number in each part of the output grid corresponds to the count of non-zero cells in the corresponding part of the input grid. Specifically, the number in the first part of the output grid is the count of non-zero cells in the third part of the input grid, the number in the second part of the output grid is the count of non-zero cells in the first part of the input grid, and the number in the third part of the output grid is the count of non-zero cells in the second part of the input grid.\n\nSo, for the quiz, the output grid would be:\n[[4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ4: Count the number of 5s in each part of the input grid in the quiz.\nA4: A4: In the first part of the input grid, there are no 5s. In the second part, there is one 5. In the third part, there are four 5s.\n\n\nQ5: Fill each part of the output grid with the number determined by the count of 5s in the corresponding part of the input grid.\nA5: A5: The first part of the output grid should be filled with the number 4, which is the count of 5s in the third part of the input grid. The second part should be filled with the number 0, which is the count of 5s in the first part of the input grid. The third part should be filled with the number 1, which is the count of 5s in the second part of the input grid. So, the output grid would be:\n[[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]]\n\n",
    "answer": "A5: The first part of the output grid should be filled with the number 4, which is the count of 5s in the third part of the input grid. The second part should be filled with the number 0, which is the count of 5s in the first part of the input grid. The third part should be filled with the number 1, which is the count of 5s in the second part of the input grid. So, the output grid would be:\n[[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]]",
