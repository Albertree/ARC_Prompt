The original input grid is copied to the left half of the output grid.\n2. The right half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the left half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the original grid. For example, in Example 1, the rotation is 9 -> 8 -> 2 -> 9. In Example 2, the rotation is 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2.\n3. The bottom half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the top half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step, following the same rotation rule as in step 2.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This is because the transformation process involves duplicating the input grid and then applying a color rotation to the duplicate before appending it to the original. This process is done both horizontally and vertically, resulting in an output grid that is twice as wide and twice as tall as the input grid. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]],\nthen the output grid would be \n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the rule for filling the first half of the output grid (the top left quadrant).\nA3: A3: The rule for filling the first half of the output grid (the top left quadrant) is simply to copy the input grid as it is. The values and their positions in the input grid are retained in the same order in the top left quadrant of the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the rule for filling the second half of the output grid (the top right quadrant).\nA4: A4: The rule for filling the second half of the output grid (the top right quadrant) is to copy the input grid but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the original grid. For example, in the quiz, the rotation is 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> 5.\n\n\nQ5: Identify the rule for filling the third part of the output grid (the bottom left quadrant).\nA5: A5: The rule for filling the third part of the output grid (the bottom left quadrant) is to mirror the top left quadrant vertically, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step, following the same rotation rule as in the top right quadrant. For example, in the quiz, the rotation is 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> 5.\n\n\nQ6: Identify the rule for filling the fourth part of the output grid (the bottom right quadrant).\nA6: A6: The rule for filling the fourth part of the output grid (the bottom right quadrant) is to mirror the top right quadrant vertically, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step, following the same rotation rule as in the top right quadrant. For example, in the quiz, the rotation is 5 -> 1 -> 9 -> 5.\n\n\nQ7: Apply these rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA7: A7: Applying these rules to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].\n\nThis output grid is generated by first copying the input grid to the top left quadrant, then creating a mirrored and color-rotated version for the top right quadrant, and finally mirroring and color-rotating the top half of the output grid to fill the bottom half.\n\n",
