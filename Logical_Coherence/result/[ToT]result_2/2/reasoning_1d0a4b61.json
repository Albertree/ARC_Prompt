This rule applies to all numbers, not just the repeating sequence of numbers (2, 5, 1, 8). \nA5: The rule identified is to replace the block of zeros with the repeating sequence of numbers (2, 5, 1, 8) and rows of 1s. The block of zeros in the quiz input grid starts from the 19th column of the 9th row and extends to the 23rd column of the 22nd row. Therefore, the output grid would be:\n\n[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1], [1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1], [1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1], [1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1], [1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1], [1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1], [1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1], [1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1], [1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]."
