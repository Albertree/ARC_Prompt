This can be done by simply checking the value of the cell in the input grid. If the value is 1, then the condition is met.\nA3: If the cell has a value of 1, we can change it to 3 by simply assigning the value 3 to the cell in the output grid. This can be done by using the indices of the cell to access it in the grid and then assigning the new value.\nA4: To identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 4s on three sides and 0 on one side, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its four neighbors (top, bottom, left, and right). If three neighbors are 4 and one neighbor is 0, then the cell meets the condition. \nA5: After identifying the cells that are surrounded by 4s on three sides and 0 on one side, we can check if these cells have a value of 1.

If two neighbors are 4 and two neighbors are 0, then the cell meets the condition. \nA8: After identifying the cells that are surrounded by 4s on two sides and 0 on two sides, we can check if these cells have a value of 1. This can be done by simply checking the value of the cell in the input grid. If the value is 1, then the condition is met.\nA9: If the cell has a value of 1, we can change it to 7 by simply assigning the value 7 to the cell in the output grid. This can be done by using the indices of the cell to access it in the grid and then assigning the new value.\nA10: To identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 4s on one side and 0 on three sides, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its four neighbors (top, bottom, left, and right). If one neighbor is 4 and three neighbors are 0, then the cell meets the condition. \nA11: After identifying the cells that are surrounded by 4s on one side and 0 on three sides, we can check if these cells have a value of 1. This can be done by simply checking the value of the cell in the input grid.

This can be done by using the indices of the cell to access it in the grid and then assigning the new value.\nA13: To identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 0s on all four sides, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its four neighbors (top, bottom, left, and right). If all four neighbors are 0, then the cell is surrounded by 0s. \nA14: After identifying the cells that are surrounded by 0s, we can check if these cells have a value of 1. This can be done by simply checking the value of the cell in the input grid. If the value is 1, then the condition is met.\nA15: If the cell has a value of 1, we can change it to 3 by simply assigning the value 3 to the cell in the output grid. This can be done by using the indices of the cell to access it in the grid and then assigning the new value.\n\nQ16: For all other cells that have not been identified in the previous steps, keep their values the same in the output grid.\nA16: For all other cells that have not been identified in the previous steps, we can keep their values the same in the output grid. This can be done by simply copying the value of the cell from the input grid to the corresponding cell in the output grid.\n\nQ17: Return the output grid.\nA17: After all the steps have been completed, we can return the output grid.
