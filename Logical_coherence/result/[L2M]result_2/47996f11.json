So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 9, 5, 5, 9, 4, 8, 8, 4, 5, 7, 7, 3,

problem in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset introduced by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, the creator of the Keras deep learning library. The ARC problem involves identifying patterns in a given input grid and applying these patterns to transform the grid into a specified output grid.\n\nIn the given problem, the pattern seems to involve identifying cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 6s and transforming these cells in a certain way to produce the output grid. However, without more specific examples or instructions, it's difficult to determine exactly what transformations should be applied to these cells. \n\nFor example, in the given input grid, the cells surrounded by 6s could be those in the middle of the grid, as the outermost rows and columns are all filled with 6s. But without knowing what should be done with these cells, we can't produce an output grid. \n\nIn general, solving an ARC problem involves carefully studying the provided examples to understand the transformations that should be applied to the input grid. This often involves identifying patterns related to the colors and positions of cells in the grid. Once the pattern is understood, it can be applied to new input grids to produce the correct output grids.\n\n\nQ2: Change the color of the cells identified in Q1 to the color of the cell that is located at the same position in the 4th row from the bottom of the grid.\nA2: A2: To solve this problem, we need to identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 6s and then change the color of these cells to the color of the cell that is located at the same position in the 4th row from the bottom of the grid. \n\nHowever, without a specific algorithm or code, it's difficult to provide the exact output. In general, this would involve iterating over each cell in the input grid, checking the surrounding cells to see if they are all 6s, and if so, changing the color of the cell to match the corresponding cell in the 4th row from the bottom.\n\nHere is a general idea of how you might implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Assume input_grid is a 2D list representing the input grid\noutput_grid = [row.copy() for row in input_grid]  # Start with a copy of the input grid\n\n# Iterate over each cell in the grid\nfor i in range(1, len(input_grid) - 1):\n    for j in range(1, len(input_grid[i]) - 1):\n        # Check if the cell is surrounded by 6s\n        if all(input_grid[x][y] == 6 for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]):\n            # Change the color of the cell in the output grid\n            output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[-4][j]\n\n# output_grid now contains the transformed grid\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the input grid is surrounded by a border of 6s, as in the examples provided. If this is not the case, you would need to adjust the code to correctly identify cells that are surrounded by 6s.\n\n",
