So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 0, 6, 6], [0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.\nA1: The pattern in the input grid seems to be a 4x13 grid with three distinct sections. The first section consists of six rows filled with a combination of 0s and 2s. The second section is a single row filled with 7s. The third section consists of six rows filled with a combination of 0s and 6s.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of the output grid.\nA2: A2: The output grid is a 4x6 grid. The pattern seems to be that the first three sections of the input grid are transformed into two sections in the output grid. The first section of the output grid consists of three rows filled with a combination of 0s and 8s, which seems to be a transformation of the first section of the input grid. The second section of the output grid consists of three rows filled with a combination of 0s and 8s, which seems to be a transformation of the third section of the input grid. The second section of the input grid (the row of 7s) is not present in the output grid.\n\n\nQ3: Determine the relationship between the positions of 2s in the top section of the input grid and the positions of 8s in the output grid.\nA3: A3: The 2s in the top section of the input grid are transformed into 8s in the output grid. The position of the 8s in the output grid is the same as the position of the 2s in the input grid, but the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid. The output grid only has three rows for each section, while the input grid has six rows for each section. Therefore, the positions of the 2s in the input grid are condensed into half the number of rows in the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: Determine the relationship between the positions of 6s in the bottom section of the input grid and the positions of 8s in the output grid.\nA4: A4: The 6s in the bottom section of the input grid are transformed into 8s in the output grid. The position of the 8s in the output grid is the same as the position of the 6s in the input grid, but the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid. The output grid only has three rows for each section, while the input grid has six rows for each section. Therefore, the positions of the 6s in the input grid are condensed into half the number of rows in the output grid.\n\nQ5: What is the output grid for the quiz?\nA5: Based on the pattern identified, the output grid for the quiz would be:\n[[0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8]].\n\n\nQ5: Apply the relationships found in Q3 and Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Based on the relationships identified in Q3 and Q4, the output grid for the quiz would be:\n[[0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8]].\n\n",
