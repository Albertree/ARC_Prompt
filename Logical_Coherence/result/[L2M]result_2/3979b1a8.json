So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve.

The original input grid is copied to the left half of the output grid.\n2. The right half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the left half, but with the colors of the cells inverted. The color inversion is done in such a way that the color of the cell in the center of the input grid is replaced with the color of the cell in the corners of the input grid, and vice versa.\n3. The bottom half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the top half, but with the colors of the cells inverted. The color inversion is done in such a way that the color of the cell in the center of the input grid is replaced with the color of the cell in the corners of the input grid, and vice versa.\n\nIn other words, the transformation involves mirroring and color inversion.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 10x10 grid, which is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 10x10 grid, which is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This is because the transformation involves copying the input grid to the left half of the output grid and then creating a mirrored version of it on the right half. The same process is then repeated vertically to fill the bottom half of the output grid.\n\nQuiz Answer:\nIf the input grid is \n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]],\nthen the output grid would be\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the first half of the output grid is a copy of the input grid, but with the center value replaced with the value in the center of the input grid's border.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. The first half of the output grid is indeed a copy of the input grid, but with the center value replaced with the value in the center of the input grid's border. This is part of the transformation pattern identified earlier. The same pattern is then mirrored on the right half of the output grid, but with the colors inverted.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the second half of the output grid is a 5x5 grid that starts with the center value of the input grid's border and then decreases by 1 in each subsequent row, until it reaches the value in the center of the input grid.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The second half of the output grid is indeed a 5x5 grid that starts with the center value of the input grid's border and then decreases by 1 in each subsequent row, until it reaches the value in the center of the input grid. This is part of the transformation pattern identified earlier. The same pattern is then mirrored on the bottom half of the output grid, but with the colors inverted.\n\n\nQ5: Apply these observations to the quiz input grid to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying these observations to the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].\n\nThis output grid is generated by first copying the input grid to the left half of the output grid, then creating a mirrored version of it on the right half with the colors inverted. The same process is then repeated vertically to fill the bottom half of the output grid.\n\n",
