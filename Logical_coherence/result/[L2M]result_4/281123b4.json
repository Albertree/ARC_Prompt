So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], [8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 9, 9, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 9, 9, 4], [9, 9, 8, 9], [5, 4, 4, 8], [9, 4, 4, 4]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 5, 0, 5, 3, 0, 9, 0, 9, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 5, 0, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[4, 9, 9, 9], [4, 9, 4, 9], [8, 4, 5, 9], [9, 8, 8, 9]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0, 3, 9, 0, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 0, 4], [8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4], [8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 9, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4], [8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 4, 9, 9], [8, 9, 4, 4], [9, 5, 0, 9], [8, 0, 4, 8]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 9, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4], [0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 5, 5, 0, 5, 3, 9, 9, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4], [8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 0, 5, 5, 0, 3, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 0, 8, 9], [9, 9, 4, 9], [9, 9, 8, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0]].\n\nExample 5\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 9, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4], [8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 5, 0, 0, 5, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[4, 8, 4, 9], [4, 9, 9, 4], [9, 9, 9, 5], [5, 5, 9, 5]].\n\nExample 6\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 9, 9, 0, 9, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4], [8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 3, 4, 0, 4, 4], [8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9, 9, 0, 9, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4], [8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 9, 8, 9], [4, 5, 4, 9], [9, 9, 0, 9], [9, 9, 0, 8]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 5, 0, 5, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 0, 4], [8, 0, 0, 8, 3, 5, 0, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 5, 5, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 0, 4, 4, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the input grid.\nA1: The pattern in the input grid seems to be that there are four distinct colors (represented by the numbers 8, 5, 9, and 4) that are grouped together in different sections of the grid. The color groups are separated by the number 3. The number 0 seems to represent empty spaces in the grid.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern in the output grid.\nA2: A2: The pattern in the output grid is that it is a 4x4 grid where each row contains a single color (represented by the numbers 8, 5, 9, and 4) from the input grid. The color groups are arranged in the same order as they appear in the input grid from top to bottom. The number 0 seems to represent empty spaces in the grid.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\nA3: A3: The transformation from the input grid to the output grid seems to be a reduction and reorganization of the input grid. The color groups in the input grid are reduced to a single row in the output grid, and the order of the color groups is preserved. The number 0 is used to fill in any empty spaces in the output grid. \n\nQ4: Apply the transformation to the quiz input grid.\nA4: Applying the transformation to the quiz input grid, the output grid would be [[9, 0, 8, 8], [9, 9, 4, 9], [9, 9, 5, 9], [8, 4, 4, 8]].\n\n\nQ4: Apply the transformation to the input grid of the quiz.\nA4: A4: Applying the transformation to the quiz input grid, the output grid would be [[9, 0, 8, 8], [9, 9, 4, 9], [9, 9, 5, 9], [8, 4, 4, 8]].\n\n",
