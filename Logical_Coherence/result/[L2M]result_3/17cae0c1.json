So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.\nA1: The pattern of the input grid is that it is divided into three equal parts horizontally. The first part is filled with zeros, the second part is filled with fives, and the third part is filled with zeros again. The fives are arranged in a way that they form a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left of the grid.\n\n\nQ2: Determine the transformation rules from the examples.\nA2: A2: The transformation rules from the examples are as follows:\n- The grid is divided into three equal parts horizontally.\n- The first part is filled with a certain number, the second part with another number, and the third part with another number.\n- The numbers filling the parts are not related to the numbers in the input grid. They are determined by the order of the parts. In the examples, the first part is filled with 3, 9, 6, 4, the second part is filled with 4, 1, 3, 6, and the third part is filled with 9, 4, 1, 3.\n- The pattern of the numbers in the input grid (the diagonal line of fives) does not affect the output grid.\n\nQ3: Apply the transformation rules to the quiz.\nA3: Applying the transformation rules to the quiz, the output grid should be:\n[[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the numbers used to fill each third of the grid.\nA3: A3: The numbers used to fill each third of the grid are 4, 6, and 3 respectively.\n\n\nQ4: Apply these rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA4: A4: Applying these rules to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be:\n[[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]].\n\n",
