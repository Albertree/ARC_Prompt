This is achieved by copying the input grid into the top left corner of the output grid, and then filling the remaining spaces with a mirrored and rotated version of the center 3x3 square of the input grid.\nA3: The output grid is not exactly a mirrored version of the input grid along both the vertical and horizontal axes. The top left quadrant of the output grid is a direct copy of the input grid. The remaining quadrants are filled with a mirrored and rotated version of the center 3x3 square of the input grid.\nA4: The pattern of transformation for each cell value in the input grid to the corresponding cells in the output grid is as follows: \nA5: Applying the transformation rules identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be:\n\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], \n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]]"
