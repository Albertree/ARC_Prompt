                "A1: The pattern of the number 7 in the input grid forms a vertical rectangle in the middle of the grid. The top and bottom rows of the rectangle are filled with 7s, while the middle rows have 7s only at the 4th, 7th, and 10th columns.\nA2: The transformation pattern involves shifting the middle 7s in the rectangle to form a diagonal line. The 7s in the 4th column move up by one row, the 7s in the 7th column stay in the same place, and the 7s in the 10th column move down by one row. This creates a zigzag or diagonal pattern within the rectangle. \nA3: Applying the transformation pattern to the number 7 pattern in the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:\nA4: The number 7 in the 4th column should be moved up by one row, the number 7 in the 7th column should stay in the same place, and the number 7 in the 10th column should be moved down by one row. This should be done for all rows in the rectangle except for the top and bottom rows, which should remain the same.\nA5: The output grid after applying the transformation to the quiz input grid is:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
