It looks like a diamond or a cross shape, with a single 4 at the top and bottom, and two lines of 4s intersecting in the middle.\nA2: Yes, the transformation rule appears to be that the pattern of 4s is mirrored both horizontally and vertically. This creates a larger, more complex pattern in the output grid. The original pattern is reflected across both the x and y axis, resulting in four copies of the original pattern arranged in a square.\nA3: Applying the transformation rule to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
