The grid is divided into two halves vertically by the column containing the number 2. \n\n2. For each half, the presence of the number 7 in a cell is replaced by the number 1, and the absence of the number 7 (represented by the number 0) is still represented by the number 0. \n\n3. The column containing the number 2 is not included in the output grid. \n\n4. The output grid is a 5x6 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. \n\nSo, the transformation involves a kind of binary conversion where the presence of the number 7 is represented by 1 and its absence by 0, and the column with the number 2 is removed.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is always smaller than the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always smaller than the input grid. This is because the column containing the number 2 in the input grid is not included in the output grid. The output grid is always a 5x6 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the role of the number 2 in the input grid.\nA3: A3: The number 2 in the input grid serves as a divider or separator between the two halves of the grid. It is always located in the middle column of the input grid. The column containing the number 2 is not included in the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: Determine the rule for transforming the left part of the input grid (before the number 2) into the left part of the output grid.\nA4: A4: The rule for transforming the left part of the input grid (before the number 2) into the left part of the output grid is as follows:\n\n1. For each cell in the left part of the input grid, if the cell contains the number 7, it is replaced by the number 1 in the output grid.\n\n2. If the cell does not contain the number 7 (i.e., it contains the number 0), it remains as 0 in the output grid.\n\nThis rule applies to each row in the left part of the input grid, resulting in the left part of the output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Determine the rule for transforming the right part of the input grid (after the number 2) into the right part of the output grid.\nA5: The rule for transforming the right part of the input grid (after the number 2) into the right part of the output grid is the same as the rule for the left part:\n\n1. For each cell in the right part of the input grid, if the cell contains the number 7, it is replaced by the number 1 in the output grid.\n\n2. If the cell does not contain the number 7 (i.e., it contains the number 0), it remains as 0 in the output grid.\n\nThis rule applies to each row in the right part of the input grid, resulting in the right part of the output grid.\n\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],\nthen the output grid is \n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]].\n\n\nQ5: Determine the rule for transforming the right part of the input grid (after the number 2) into the right part of the output grid.\nA5: A5: The rule for transforming the right part of the input grid (after the number 2) into the right part of the output grid is the same as the rule for the left part:\n\n1. For each cell in the right part of the input grid, if the cell contains the number 7, it is replaced by the number 1 in the output grid.\n\n2. If the cell does not contain the number 7 (i.e., it contains the number 0), it remains as 0 in the output grid.\n\nThis rule applies to each row in the right part of the input grid, resulting in the right part of the output grid.\n\n\nQ6: Combine the results from Q4 and Q5 to generate the complete output grid.\nA6: A6: To generate the complete output grid, we combine the transformed left and right parts of the input grid. \n\n1. We start by applying the transformation rule to the left part of the input grid (before the number 2), replacing each occurrence of the number 7 with the number 1 and leaving the number 0 as it is. \n\n2. We then apply the same transformation rule to the right part of the input grid (after the number 2), again replacing each occurrence of the number 7 with the number 1 and leaving the number 0 as it is. \n\n3. Finally, we combine the transformed left and right parts to form the complete output grid. \n\nFor example, if the input grid is \n[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],\nthe output grid is \n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]].\n\n",
