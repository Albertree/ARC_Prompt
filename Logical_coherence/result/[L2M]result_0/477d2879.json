The corresponding colors are not specified in the problem, as the numbers themselves represent different colors. For example, 0 could represent the color white, 1 could represent the color black, and so on. The actual color representation would depend on the specific color mapping used in the problem context.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of the unique numbers in the grid.\nA2: A2: The pattern of the unique numbers in the grid seems to be that they form different shapes or objects within the grid. For example, the number 1 forms a sort of border around the grid and also appears in clusters within the grid. The numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 each appear only once in the grid, while the number 0 fills in the rest of the grid. The pattern seems to involve these numbers moving or changing in some way to form the output grid, as seen in the examples.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the cells that are surrounded by 1s.\nA3: A3: The cells that are surrounded by 1s are the cells at positions (2,3), (5,8), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), and (11,7).\n\n\nQ4: Identify the cells that are not surrounded by 1s but contain unique numbers.\nA4: A4: The cells that are not surrounded by 1s but contain unique numbers are the cells at positions (0,1), (0,3), (4,2), (5,9), (7,11), and (11,3).\n\n\nQ5: Determine the transformation rules from the examples given.\nA5: A5: From the examples given, the transformation rules seem to be as follows:\n\n1. The cells that are completely surrounded by 1s in the input grid are filled with the unique number that is not 0 or 1 in the output grid. \n\n2. The cells that are not surrounded by 1s but contain unique numbers in the input grid are filled with the number 1 in the output grid.\n\n3. The cells that contain the number 1 in the input grid are filled with the unique number that is not 0 or 1 in the output grid.\n\n4. The cells that contain the number 0 in the input grid are filled with the number 1 in the output grid.\n\n5. The cells that contain the unique number that is not 0 or 1 in the input grid are filled with the number 0 in the output grid.\n\nThese rules are inferred from the examples and may not be completely accurate. The actual transformation rules could be more complex and may involve other factors not visible in the examples.\n\n\nQ6: Apply the transformation rules to the cells identified in Q3 and Q4.\nA6: A6: Applying the transformation rules to the cells identified in Q3 and Q4, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]].\n\nThis output grid is obtained by applying the transformation rules to the input grid. The cells that are completely surrounded by 1s in the input grid are filled with the unique number that is not 0 or 1 in the output grid. The cells that are not surrounded by 1s but contain unique numbers in the input grid are filled with the number 1 in the output grid. The cells that contain the number 1 in the input grid are filled with the unique number that is not 0 or 1 in the output grid.
