So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve.

The pattern in the input grids of the examples is that there is a square of the same number in the middle of the grid. The size of the square and the number itself varies in each example, but the position remains the same. The square is always surrounded by other numbers, but these other numbers do not seem to follow a specific pattern.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern in the output grids of the examples.\nA2: A2: The pattern in the output grids of the examples is that they are all 3x3 grids filled with the same number. This number is the same as the one that filled the square in the middle of the corresponding input grid.\n\n\nQ3: How does the pattern in the input grids relate to the pattern in the output grids?.\nA3: A3: The pattern in the input grids relates to the pattern in the output grids in that the number that fills the square in the middle of the input grid is the same number that fills the entire output grid. The size and position of the square in the input grid does not seem to affect the output grid, as the output is always a 3x3 grid filled with the same number.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the areas in the input grid of the quiz that match the pattern identified in Q1.\nA4: A4: The area in the input grid of the quiz that matches the pattern identified in Q1 is a square of the number 5 in the middle of the grid. The square is of size 5x5 and is surrounded by other numbers.\n\n\nQ5: Based on the pattern identified in Q3, predict what changes will be made to these areas in the output grid.\nA5: A5: Based on the pattern identified in Q3, the output grid will be a 3x3 grid filled with the number 5, which is the number that fills the square in the middle of the input grid.\n\n\nQ6: Based on the pattern identified in Q2, predict what the rest of the output grid will look like.\nA6: A6: Based on the pattern identified in Q2, the rest of the output grid will also be filled with the number 5. So, the entire output grid will be a 3x3 grid filled with the number 5.\n\n",
