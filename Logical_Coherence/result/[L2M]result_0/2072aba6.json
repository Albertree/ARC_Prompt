    "prompt": "\nDo you know ARC problem?\n\nIt is similary below.\n\n=========\nExample 1\n\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\n=========\n\nYou can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.\nIn above case, you can inference like below.\n\nIn example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1], [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2], [0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0], [2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the positions of the number 5 in the input grid.\nA1: A1: The number 5 is located at the positions (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) in the input grid.\n\n\nQ2: For each position of 5, replace it with a 2x2 grid of alternating 1s and 2s, starting with 1 in the top left.\nA2: A2: The output grid will be as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0], \n [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], \n [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1], \n [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]]\n\n\nQ3: If the position of 5 is on the edge of the grid, ensure the 2x2 grid is placed such that it does not extend beyond the edge of the output grid.\nA3: A3: In this case, the positions of 5 are not on the edge of the grid, so we don't need to worry about the 2x2 grid extending beyond the edge of the output grid. The output grid remains the same as in A2.\n\n\nQ4: If there are multiple 5s in the input grid, ensure the 2x2 grids do not overlap in the output grid.\nA4: A4: In this case, there are multiple 5s in the input grid. However, they are placed in such a way that the 2x2 grids do not overlap in the output grid. The output grid remains the same as in A2.\n\n\nQ5: Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with 0s.\nA5: A5: The remaining cells in the output grid are already filled with 0s. So, the final output grid is:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0], \n [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], \n [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1], \n [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]]\n\n",
