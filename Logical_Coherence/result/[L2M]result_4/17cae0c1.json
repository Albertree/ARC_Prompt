So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.\nA1: The pattern of the input grid is that it is divided into three equal parts horizontally. The first part is filled with zeros, the second part is filled with fives, and the third part is filled with zeros again. However, in each part, there is a single cell filled with the other number. In the first part, the last cell of the second row is filled with five. In the second part, the middle cell of the second row is filled with zero. In the third part, the first cell of the second row is filled with five.\n\n\nQ2: Determine the corresponding output for each position of the 5x5 square in the input grid.\nA2: A2: The corresponding output for each position of the 5x5 square in the input grid is determined by the pattern observed in the examples. The pattern is that each third of the grid is filled with a different number, starting with 4 in the first third, 6 in the second third, and 3 in the last third. Therefore, the output grid would be:\n\n[[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]]\n\n\nQ3: Identify the rule for assigning numbers to each section of the output grid.\nA3: A3: The rule for assigning numbers to each section of the output grid seems to be based on the position of the sections in the input grid. The first section (leftmost) of the output grid is filled with 4, the second section (middle) is filled with 6, and the third section (rightmost) is filled with 3. This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided.\n\n\nQ4: Apply the rule identified in Q3 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA4: A4: Applying the rule identified in Q3 to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be:\n\n[[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]]\n\n",
