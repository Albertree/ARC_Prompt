So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3], [0, 1, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 5, 8, 0, 8], [5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 0], [0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1], [2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5], [0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 5]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the row that is entirely filled with 1s in the input grid.\nA1: A1: The row that is entirely filled with 1s in the input grid is the 8th row.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the columns that contain the number 1 in the input grid.\nA2: A2: The columns that contain the number 1 in the input grid are the 7th column.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the unique numbers in the grid that are not 0 or 1.\nA3: A3: The unique numbers in the grid that are not 0 or 1 are 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\n\nQ4: For each unique number identified in Q3, find the rows that contain this number.\nA4: A4: The rows that contain the number 2 are the 4th, 5th, and 6th rows.
