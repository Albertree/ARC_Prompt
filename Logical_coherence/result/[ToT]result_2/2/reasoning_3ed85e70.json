If it is, record the coordinates of that cell. \nA4: Similar to the previous questions, you can iterate over each cell in the grid and check if the value is 6. If it is, record the coordinates of that cell.\nA5: As with the previous questions, iterate over each cell in the grid and check if the value is 4. If it is, record the coordinates of that cell.\nA6: From the examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves creating a square or rectangle around the number 8 in the input grid. The square or rectangle is formed by the number 1, and the number 2 is placed in the middle of the square or rectangle. The number 4 is placed in the corners of the square or rectangle. The number 6 is placed outside the square or rectangle, in the same row or column as the number 8. The rest of the grid remains the same. \nA7: To apply the transformation pattern to the quiz input grid, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the locations of the number 8 in the input grid. Let's call these locations \"8-locations\".\n\n2. For each 8-location, find the nearest locations of the number 1, 2, 4, and 6. Let's call these locations \"1-locations\", \"2-locations\", \"4-locations\", and \"6-locations\" respectively.\n\n3. Create a square or rectangle around each 8-location using the number 1. The size of the square or rectangle should be the same as the distance between the 8-location and the nearest 1-location.\n\n4. Place the number 2 in the middle of each square or rectangle.\n\n5. Place the number 4 in the corners of each square or rectangle.\n\n6. Place the number 6 outside each square or rectangle, in the same row or column as the 8-location.\n\n7. The rest of the grid remains the same.\n\nThis process should generate the output grid."
