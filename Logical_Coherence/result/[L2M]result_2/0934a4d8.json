So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 1, 1, 9, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 3,

examples.\nA1: The pattern in the input and output grids of the examples is that the output grid is a smaller section of the input grid. The output grid is always a square and is located in the center of the input grid. The size of the output grid depends on the size of the input grid. If the input grid is 30x30, the output grid is 7x7. If the input grid is 20x20, the output grid is 5x5. If the input grid is 10x10, the output grid is 3x3.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grids are always 4x4, regardless of the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Actually, the output grids are not always 4x4. The size of the output grid depends on the size of the input grid. For example, if the input grid is 30x30, the output grid is 7x7. If the input grid is 20x20, the output grid is 5x5. If the input grid is 10x10, the output grid is 3x3.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the specific 4x4 section of the input grid that is transformed into the output grid.\nA3: A3: The specific section of the input grid that is transformed into the output grid is the center of the input grid. The output grid is a square that is centered in the input grid. The size of this square depends on the size of the input grid. For example, if the input grid is 30x30, the output grid is a 7x7 square in the center of the input grid. If the input grid is 20x20, the output grid is a 5x5 square in the center, and so on.\n\n\nQ4: Determine the rule or transformation that is applied to this 4x4 section to produce the output grid.\nA4: A4: The rule or transformation applied to the section of the input grid to produce the output grid is simply extraction. No changes are made to the values or arrangement of the cells in the section. The section is directly extracted from the input grid and presented as the output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply this rule or transformation to the corresponding 4x4 section of the input grid in the quiz to produce the output grid.\nA5: A5: The input grid in the quiz is 30x30, so the output grid will be a 7x7 square in the center of the input grid. The output grid is:\n\n[[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], \n [8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8], \n [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], \n [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]]\n\n",
