The original input grid is copied to the left half of the output grid.\n2. The right half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the left half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center column of the input grid, from top to bottom.\n3. The bottom half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the top half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center row of the input grid, from left to right.\n\nIn other words, the transformation involves mirroring and color rotation.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions. This is because the transformation involves copying the input grid to the left half of the output grid, and then creating a mirrored version of this on the right half. Similarly, the top half of the output grid is mirrored to create the bottom half. This effectively doubles the size of the grid in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]],\nthen the output grid would be\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the rule for filling the first half of the output grid.\nA3: A3: The rule for filling the first half of the output grid is simply to copy the input grid as it is. The left half of the output grid is an exact replica of the input grid.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the rule for filling the second half of the output grid.\nA4: A4: The rule for filling the second half of the output grid is to create a mirrored version of the left half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center column of the input grid, from top to bottom.\n\n\nQ5: Determine the rule for changing the values in the second half of the output grid.\nA5: A5: The rule for changing the values in the second half of the output grid is to rotate the colors of the cells clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center column of the input grid, from top to bottom. This means that the color of each cell in the second half of the output grid is replaced by the color of the next cell down in the center column of the input grid. If the cell is at the bottom of the column, its color is replaced by the color of the top cell in the column.\n\n\nQ6: Apply these rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA6: A6: Applying these rules to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].\n\nThis output grid is generated by first copying the input grid to the left half of the output grid, then creating a mirrored version of this on the right half with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The bottom half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the top half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center row and column of the input grid.\n\n",
