This results in a grid that is four times larger than the original.\nA4: Applying the identified transformation to the pattern of 4s in the quiz input grid, we get the following pattern:\nA5: Applying the identified grid size transformation to the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]]"
