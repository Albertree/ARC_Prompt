The grid is divided into two halves vertically, separated by the column containing the number 2.\n\n2. For each half, the cells with the number 7 are converted to 1, and the cells with the number 0 remain as 0.\n\n3. The output grid only contains the transformed cells from the first three columns of each half, excluding the column with the number 2. \n\nSo, the transformation involves converting the number 7 to 1, keeping the number 0 as is, and selecting the first three columns from each half of the grid.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is always 5x6, regardless of the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always of size 5x6. This is because the transformation only takes the first three columns from each half of the input grid, resulting in a total of six columns. The number of rows remains the same as the input grid, which is five in all the given examples.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the role of the number 2 in the input grid.\nA3: A3: The number 2 in the input grid acts as a separator or divider. It divides the grid into two halves vertically. The transformation is applied separately to each half of the grid. The column containing the number 2 is not included in the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the output grid is formed by the cells to the left and right of the number 2 in the input grid.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The output grid is formed by the cells to the left and right of the number 2 in the input grid. Specifically, it includes the first three columns from each half of the input grid. The column containing the number 2 is not included in the output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Identify the transformation rule for the cells in the output grid.\nA5: A5: The transformation rule for the cells in the output grid is as follows: \n\n- If a cell in the input grid contains the number 7, it is transformed to a cell containing the number 1 in the output grid.\n- If a cell in the input grid contains the number 0, it remains as a cell containing the number 0 in the output grid. \n\nThis rule is applied to the first three columns of each half of the input grid, excluding the column with the number 2.\n\n\nQ6: Apply the transformation rule to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA6: A6: The input grid for the quiz is:\n\n[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], \n [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], \n [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]]\n\nApplying the transformation rule, we get the output grid:\n\n[[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], \n [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], \n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]]\n\n",
