The colors 2, 3, and 4 seem to be positioned in a specific order, with color 4 at the top, color 2 below it, and color 3 to the right of color 2.\nA4: In the examples, the color 8 in the input grid is replaced by the colors 2, 3, and 4 in the output grid. The replacement follows a specific order: the top part of the cross is replaced by color 2, the middle part by color 3, and the bottom part by color 4. The left and right parts of the cross remain the same color 8.\nA5: Applying the identified changes to the quiz input grid, the top part of the cross (color 8) is replaced by color 2, the middle part by color 3, and the bottom part by color 4. The left and right parts of the cross remain the same color 8.
