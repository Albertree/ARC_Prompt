So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 0], [0, 7]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that each row and column of the input grid is duplicated in the output grid. This results in an output grid that is twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions. The values in the cells of the output grid are the same as the corresponding cells in the input grid.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\nA2: A2: Yes, that's correct. The output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the first half of the rows and columns in the output grid are a duplicate of the input grid, and the second half is a mirror image of the first half.\n\n\nQ3: Determine the size of the output grid based on the size of the input grid.\nA3: A3: The size of the output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions. If the input grid is of size m x n, then the output grid will be of size 2m x 2n.\n\n\nQ4: Create a new grid of the appropriate size for the output.\nA4: A4: To create a new grid of the appropriate size for the output, you would first determine the size of the input grid. If the input grid is of size m x n, then the output grid will be of size 2m x 2n. You can create a new grid of this size filled with zeros, and then fill in the appropriate values based on the input grid. For example, in Python, you could use a nested list comprehension to create the new grid:\n\n```python\nm, n = len(input_grid), len(input_grid[0])\noutput_grid = [[0 for _ in range(2*n)] for _ in range(2*m)]\n```\n\nThen, you would fill in the values based on the input grid:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(n):\n        output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n        output_grid[i][j+n] = input_grid[i][j]\n        output_grid[i+m][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n        output_grid[i+m][j+n] = input_grid[i][j]\n```\n\nThis would result in an output grid that is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\n\n\nQ5: Copy the values from the input grid into the appropriate positions in the output grid, mirroring them both horizontally and vertically.\nA5: A5: Yes, that's correct. To copy the values from the input grid into the appropriate positions in the output grid, you would iterate over each cell in the input grid. For each cell, you would copy its value into four positions in the output grid: the position corresponding to the cell's position in the input grid, the position mirrored horizontally, the position mirrored vertically, and the position mirrored both horizontally and vertically. This can be done with a nested loop, like so:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(m):\n    for j in range(n):\n        output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n        output_grid[i][j+n] = input_grid[i][j]\n        output_grid[i+m][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n        output_grid[i+m][j+n] = input_grid[i][j]\n```\n\nThis will result in an output grid that is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\n\n\nQ6: Verify that the output grid matches the expected pattern from the examples.\nA6: A6: To verify that the output grid matches the expected pattern from the examples, you can compare the output grid to the expected output grid. If they match, then the transformation has been performed correctly. If they do not match, then there may be an error in the transformation process. \n\nIn Python, you can use the `==` operator to compare two lists (which can be used to represent grids). If the two lists are the same, then `==` will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.\n\nFor example, if `expected_output_grid` is the expected output grid and `output_grid` is the output grid produced by your transformation, you can check if they match like so:\n\n```python\nif output_grid == expected_output_grid:\n    print(\"The output grid matches the expected pattern.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The output grid does not match the expected pattern.\")\n```\n\nThis will print a message indicating whether or not the output grid matches the expected pattern.\n\n",
