So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 0, 6, 6], [0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.\nA1: The pattern in the input grid seems to be a 13x4 grid with three distinct sections. The first section consists of six rows with numbers 0, 2, and occasionally other numbers. The second section is a single row of the number 7. The third section consists of six rows with numbers 0, 6, and occasionally other numbers. The numbers 2 and 6 seem to form various patterns within their respective sections.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, with the row of 7s removed and the 2s and 6s replaced with 8s.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a 6x4 grid where the row of 7s from the input grid is removed. The numbers 2 and 6 from the input grid are replaced with 8s in the output grid. The pattern of 8s in the output grid seems to mirror the pattern of 2s and 6s in the input grid. \n\nQ3: What is the transformation rule from the input grid to the output grid?\nA3: The transformation rule appears to be as follows: \n1. Remove the row of 7s from the input grid.\n2. Replace the numbers 2 and 6 in the remaining rows with 8s.\n3. The pattern of 8s in the output grid should mirror the pattern of 2s and 6s in the input grid.\n\nQ4: What is the output grid for the quiz?\nA4: Applying the transformation rule to the quiz input grid, the output grid should be:\n[[0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the pattern of transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\nA3: A3: The transformation pattern from the input grid to the output grid seems to be as follows: \n1. Remove the row of 7s from the input grid.\n2. Replace the numbers 2 and 6 in the remaining rows with 8s.\n3. The pattern of 8s in the output grid should mirror the pattern of 2s and 6s in the input grid.\n\n\nQ4: Apply this transformation to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA4: A4: Applying the transformation rule to the quiz input grid, the output grid should be:\n[[0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8]].\n\n",
