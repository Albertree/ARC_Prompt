The cells that were previously part of the square and are now outside the diamond should be changed to 0s, and the cells that were previously empty spaces inside the square and are now inside the diamond should be changed to 7s.\nA5: Applying the transformation to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid should be:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
