If all the surrounding cells are 3s, then the cell is surrounded by 3s. \nA2: Similar to the previous question, to identify the cells that are surrounded by 1s in the input grid, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its surrounding cells. If all the surrounding cells are 1s, then the cell is surrounded by 1s.\nA3: Similar to the previous questions, to identify the cells that are surrounded by 2s in the input grid, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its surrounding cells. If all the surrounding cells are 2s, then the cell is surrounded by 2s.\nA4: Similar to the previous questions, to identify the cells that are surrounded by 4s in the input grid, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its surrounding cells.

If all the surrounding cells are 9s, then the cell is surrounded by 9s.\nA10: To create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, but filled with 0s, we can use a nested list comprehension. The outer list comprehension iterates over the rows in the input grid, and the inner list comprehension iterates over the cells in each row. For each cell, we simply put a 0 in the new grid. Here is the Python code to do this:\nA11: To replace the corresponding cell in the new grid with the number of the question, we can use a nested loop to iterate over each cell in the grid. If the cell was identified in Q1-Q9, we replace the corresponding cell in the new grid with the number of the question. Here is the Python code to do this:\nA12: After performing all the operations, we can return the new grid as the output. This grid will contain the numbers of the questions for the cells that were surrounded by the corresponding numbers in the input grid, and 0s for all other cells. Here is the Python code to do this:\n\n```python\ndef solve_arc_problem(input_grid):\n    # Q10: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, but filled with 0s.\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n\n    # Q1-Q9: Identify the cells that are surrounded by 1-9 in the input grid.\n    for i in range(1, len(input_grid) - 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(input_grid[0]) - 1):\n            for num in range(1, 10):\n                if all(input_grid[i + di][j + dj] == num for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if di != 0 or dj != 0):\n                    # Q11: Replace the corresponding cell in the new grid with the number of the question.\n                    output_grid[i][j] = num\n\n    # Q12: Return the new grid as the output.\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThis function takes an input grid as an argument, identifies the cells that are surrounded by each number from 1 to 9, and creates a new grid where these cells are replaced with the corresponding numbers.
