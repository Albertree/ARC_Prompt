If the cell in the input grid contains any number other than 7, the corresponding cell in the output grid will contain the number 0.\nA5: The rule for transforming the number 7 in the input grid to the number 1 in the output grid is straightforward. If a cell in the last seven columns of the input grid contains the number 7, the corresponding cell in the output grid will contain the number 1. If the cell in the input grid contains any number other than 7, the corresponding cell in the output grid will contain the number 0.\nA6: Applying the rule identified in Q5 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]]"

                "A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that the first six columns of the input grid are ignored and the remaining seven columns are transformed into six columns in the output grid. The transformation rules are as follows:\nA2: Yes, the output grid is always a 5x6 grid. This is because the transformation process only considers the last seven columns of the input grid and transforms them into six columns in the output grid.\nA3: Yes, the 7th column in the input grid is always filled with the number 2, which does not appear in the output grid. This column seems to act as a separator between the ignored part of the grid and the part that is transformed into the output grid.\nA4: The number 7 in the input grid corresponds to the number 1 in the output grid. If a cell in the last seven columns of the input grid contains the number 7, the corresponding cell in the output grid will contain the number 1. If the cell in the input grid contains any number other than 7, the corresponding cell in the output grid will contain the number 0.\nA5: The rule for transforming the number 7 in the input grid to the number 1 in the output grid is straightforward.
