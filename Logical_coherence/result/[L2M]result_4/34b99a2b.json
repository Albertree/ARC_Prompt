So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 5], [8, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[2, 0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2], [2, 0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5], [8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 2]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 5, 5, 5], [0, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5], [8, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern of the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: The pattern of transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples seems to be based on the count of the number 8 in each row and column. \n\nIn the output grid, the number 2 is placed in the position where the number 8 is present in the input grid. The number of 2's in each row and column of the output grid is equal to the number of 8's in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first row of the input grid has two 8's, so the first row of the output grid has two 2's. Similarly, the first column of the input grid has four 8's, so the first column of the output grid has four 2's. \n\nThis pattern is consistent across all the examples.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is always 4 columns wide.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always 4 columns wide. This seems to be a fixed dimension for the output grid in this problem. The number of rows remains the same as the input grid, but the number of columns is reduced to 4 in the output grid. The placement of the number 2 in these 4 columns is determined by the count of the number 8 in the corresponding rows and columns of the input grid. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nBased on the identified pattern, the output grid for the quiz would be:\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 2]]\n\n\nQ3: Notice that the output grid has the same number of rows as the input grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, the output grid maintains the same number of rows as the input grid. This is consistent across all the examples. The transformation seems to only affect the number of columns and the placement of the number 2, which is based on the count of the number 8 in the corresponding rows and columns of the input grid.\n\n\nQ4: Identify how the values in the cells of the input grid are transformed to the values in the output grid.\nA4: A4: The transformation of the values in the cells from the input grid to the output grid is based on the presence of the number 8 in the input grid. If the number 8 is present in a cell in the input grid, the corresponding cell in the output grid will have the number 2. The number of 2's in each row and column of the output grid is equal to the number of 8's in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. All other cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell with the number 8 in the input grid are filled with 0.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the transformations identified in Q2, Q3, and Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the transformations identified in Q2, Q3, and Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2, 2]].\n\nThis output grid is generated by maintaining the same number of rows as the input grid, reducing the number of columns to 4, and placing the number 2 in the cells corresponding to the cells with the number 8 in the input grid. The number of 2's in each row and column of the output grid is equal to the number of 8's in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. All other cells in the output grid are filled with 0.\n\n",
