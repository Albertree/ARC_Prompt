So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 5\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [3, 0, 2, 2, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the positions of the number 3 in the input grid.\nA1: The positions of the number 3 in the input grid are: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1).\n\n\nQ2: Count the number of 3s in the top, middle, and bottom sections of the grid.\nA2: A2: The number of 3s in the top section of the grid is 4, in the middle section is 1, and in the bottom section is 4.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the positions of the number 2 in the input grid.\nA3: A3: The positions of the number 2 in the input grid are: (3, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 3), (7, 4).\n\n\nQ4: Count the number of 2s in the top, middle, and bottom sections of the grid.\nA4: A4: The number of 2s in the top section of the grid is 1, in the middle section is 0, and in the bottom section is 4.\n\n\nQ5: Create a 3x3 output grid.\nA5: A5: The output grid is created based on the count of 3s and 2s in the top, middle, and bottom sections of the input grid. The output grid is as follows:\n\n[[1, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0], \n [1, 0, 1]]\n\n\nQ6: If there are more 3s than 2s in the top section of the input grid, place a 1 in the top cell of the output grid.\nA6: A6: Yes, there are more 3s than 2s in the top section of the input grid. Therefore, a 1 is placed in the top cell of the output grid.\n\n\nQ7: If there are more 3s than 2s in the middle section of the input grid, place a 1 in the middle cell of the output grid.\nA7: A7: No, there are not more 3s than 2s in the middle section of the input grid. Therefore, a 0 is placed in the middle cell of the output grid.\n\n\nQ8: If there are more 3s than 2s in the bottom section of the input grid, place a 1 in the bottom cell of the output grid.\nA8: A8: Yes, there are more 3s than 2s in the bottom section of the input grid. Therefore, a 1 is placed in the bottom cell of the output grid.\n\n\nQ9: Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with 0s.\nA9: A9: Yes, the remaining cells in the output grid are filled with 0s. The final output grid is as follows:\n\n[[1, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0], \n [1, 0, 1]]\n\n",
