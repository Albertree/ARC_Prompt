                "A1: The pattern in the input grid is that there are groups of the number 8 forming a specific shape, and there are other numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) scattered around the grid. The number 8 forms a larger shape that resembles a cross or a plus sign. The other numbers are located in different positions in each example, but they are always inside the shape formed by the number 8.\nA2: In the output grid, the shape formed by the number 8 in the input grid is replaced by the numbers scattered around the grid. The number that replaces the 8 is determined by the position of the scattered numbers in the input grid. For example, in the first example, the number 2 replaces the top part of the 8 shape, the number 1 replaces the middle part, the number 3 replaces the bottom part, and the number 4 replaces the sides. The same pattern is followed in the second example.\nA3: The position of the numbers in the input grid determines which part of the 8 shape they will replace in the output grid. The number that is closest to the top of the grid replaces the top part of the 8 shape, the number that is closest to the bottom replaces the bottom part, and the numbers that are closest to the sides replace the sides. The number that is in the middle of the grid replaces the middle part of the 8 shape.\nA4: The input grid of the quiz follows the same pattern as the examples. The number 8 forms a shape, and the numbers 2, 3, and 4 are scattered around the grid. The number 2 is closest to the top of the grid, so it will replace the top part of the 8 shape. The number 3 is in the middle, so it will replace the middle part. The number 4 is closest to the bottom, so it will replace the bottom part. Therefore, the output grid should be:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
