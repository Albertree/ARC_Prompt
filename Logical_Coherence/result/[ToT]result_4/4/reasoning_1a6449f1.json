                "A1: To identify the cells that are surrounded by 3s in the input grid, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its surrounding cells. If all the surrounding cells are 3s, then the cell is surrounded by 3s. \nA2: Similar to the previous question, to identify the cells that are surrounded by 1s in the input grid, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its surrounding cells. If all the surrounding cells are 1s, then the cell is surrounded by 1s.\nA3: Similar to the previous questions, to identify the cells that are surrounded by 8s in the input grid, we need to iterate over each cell in the grid and check its surrounding cells. If all the surrounding cells are 8s, then the cell is surrounded by 8s.\nA4: To create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, we can use a nested list comprehension. If the input grid is stored in a variable called `input_grid`, we can create a new grid with the same dimensions using the following code:\nA5: To fill in the new grid with the values from the cells identified in Q1, Q2, and Q3, we can iterate over each cell in the input grid again. If a cell was identified as being surrounded by 3s, 1s, or 8s, we can copy its value to the corresponding cell in the new grid. Otherwise, we can leave the cell in the new grid as 0. \nA6: If we have followed the steps in Q5 correctly, all cells in the new grid that were not filled should already be 0s. This is because we initialized the new grid with 0s in Q4. If this is not the case, we can iterate over each cell in the new grid and set any cell that is still None or any other placeholder value to 0."
