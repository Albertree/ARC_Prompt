The grid is divided into two halves vertically by the column containing the number 2. \n\n2. The left half of the grid is transformed into a new grid where all non-zero numbers are replaced by 1 and zero remains as zero. \n\n3. The right half of the grid is discarded.\n\n4. The new grid is a 5x6 grid, which is the left half of the original grid after the transformation. \n\nThis pattern is consistent across all the examples.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a smaller version of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a smaller version of the input grid. This is because the transformation process involves discarding the right half of the input grid and only keeping the left half. The numbers in the left half are then replaced by 1s (if they were non-zero) or 0s (if they were already 0), resulting in a smaller, simplified version of the original grid. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],\nthen the output grid would be \n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the role of the number 2 in the input grid.\nA3: A3: The number 2 in the input grid serves as a divider or boundary between the two halves of the grid. It is always located in the middle column of the input grid, effectively splitting the grid into a left half and a right half. The transformation process only keeps the left half of the grid, while the right half (including the column with the number 2) is discarded.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the output grid only contains the numbers 0 and 1.\nA4: A4: Yes, the output grid only contains the numbers 0 and 1. This is because the transformation process involves replacing all non-zero numbers in the left half of the input grid with 1, while zero remains as zero. This simplifies the grid and reduces the variety of numbers in it, resulting in an output grid that only contains 0s and 1s.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the identified transformation rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: To generate the output grid from the input grid of the quiz, we first split the input grid into two halves vertically at the column containing the number 2. We then discard the right half of the grid. For the left half, we replace all non-zero numbers with 1 and leave the zeros as they are. \n\nSo, if the input grid is \n[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],\nthen the output grid would be \n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]].\n\n",
