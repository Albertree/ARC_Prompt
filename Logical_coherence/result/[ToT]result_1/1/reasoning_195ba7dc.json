                "A1: The pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid is as follows:\nA2: Yes, the output grid is always a 5x6 grid. The transformation seems to be based on the presence of certain numbers in the input grid. Specifically, the number 7 and 2 seem to play a role in the transformation. \nA3: Yes, the number 2 acts as a divider in the input grid. The transformation seems to be based on the presence of the number 7 in the six columns to the left and right of the number 2. If there is at least one number 7 in a column, the corresponding cell in the output grid is 1, otherwise it is 0. \nA4: Yes, the output grid is formed by the cells to the left and right of the number 2 in the input grid. The transformation seems to be based on the presence of the number 7 in the six columns to the left and right of the number 2. If there is at least one number 7 in a column, the corresponding cell in the output grid is 1, otherwise it is 0.\nA5: The transformation rule is not directly based on the individual cells in the input grid, but rather on the columns. If there is at least one number 7 in a column to the left or right of the number 2 in the input grid, the corresponding cell in the output grid is 1. If there is no number 7 in a column, the corresponding cell in the output grid is 0. \nA6: Applying the transformation rule to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]]"
