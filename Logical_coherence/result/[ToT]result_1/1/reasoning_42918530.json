The same rule of replacing zeros with the group number if it is surrounded by the same number on its top and bottom is applied in all examples.\nA4: The specific cells that are changed from the input to the output grid are the cells that contain a zero and are surrounded by the same number on its top and bottom. These cells are replaced by the group number.\nA5: The rule for changing the cells is that if a cell contains a zero and is surrounded by the same number on its top and bottom, it is replaced by that number. If a cell contains a zero and is surrounded by the same number on its left and right, it remains a zero.\nA6: Applying the rule to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
