So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[2, 0], [0, 3]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 3], [0, 2]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 5, 5, 8, 8, 4, 4, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 5, 5, 8, 8, 4, 4, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[5, 4], [3, 0]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the different colors present in the grid.\nA1: The different colors present in the grid are 0, 8, 2, 6, 1, and 3.\n\n\nQ2: Count the number of cells for each color.\nA2: A2: The number of cells for each color are as follows:\n- Color 0: 98 cells\n- Color 8: 96 cells\n- Color 2: 4 cells\n- Color 6: 4 cells\n- Color 1: 4 cells\n- Color 3: 4 cells\n\nQ3: What is the pattern observed in the grid?\nA3: The pattern observed in the grid is that there are two pairs of colored cells (2, 6) and (1, 3) located symmetrically within the grid filled with color 8. The pairs are located at the same distance from the center of the grid.\n\nQ4: What is the expected output based on the pattern?\nA4: Based on the pattern observed in the examples, the expected output would be a 2x2 grid with the colors of the pairs in the same order they appear in the input grid from top to bottom and left to right. So, the output grid would be [[2, 6], [1, 3]].\n\n\nQ3: Arrange the colors and their counts in the order of their appearance in the grid.\nA3: A3: The colors and their counts in the order of their appearance in the grid are as follows:\n- Color 0: 98 cells\n- Color 8: 96 cells\n- Color 2: 4 cells\n- Color 6: 4 cells\n- Color 1: 4 cells\n- Color 3: 4 cells\n\n\nQ4: Create a new grid with the color as the first element and the count as the second element for each color.\nA4: A4: Based on the pattern observed in the examples, the new grid would be a 2x2 grid with the colors of the pairs in the same order they appear in the input grid from top to bottom and left to right. So, the new grid would be [[2, 6], [1, 3]].\n\n",
