                "A1: The pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid is that each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 grid in the output. The center cell of this 3x3 grid is the same as the original cell, the top center cell is 2, and the rest of the cells are 0. This pattern is applied to all cells in the input grid.\nA2: Yes, the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This is because each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 grid in the output.\nA3: Yes, every cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. The original cell value is placed in the center of the 3x3 grid, the top center cell is 2, and the rest of the cells are 0. \nA4: The rule for transforming the value of each cell in the input grid to the corresponding cells in the output grid is as follows: The original cell value is placed in the center of the 3x3 grid, the top center cell is 2, and the rest of the cells are 0. If the original cell value is 0, it remains 0 in the output grid, but the top center cell of the 3x3 grid becomes 2. If the original cell value is not 0, it remains the same in the output grid, and the top center cell of the 3x3 grid is still 2.\nA5: Applying the transformation rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
