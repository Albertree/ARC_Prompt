If a cell is in the second row or second last row, or the second column or second last column, we change its value to 2. This will only happen if the square or rectangle is large enough to have a second outermost layer.\nA5: To repeat the process for all the squares or rectangles of 3s in the input grid, we can encapsulate the steps in Q1 to Q4 in a function and call this function for each cell in the grid. We can keep track of the cells that we have already processed to avoid processing them multiple times.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the quiz.\n\nQuiz Answer:\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids are\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0], [0, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."

For each cell that is a 3, we can check if its right neighbor and bottom neighbor are also 3s.
