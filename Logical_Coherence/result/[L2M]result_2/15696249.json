The input grid is a 3x3 matrix. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. The first three rows of the output grid are a repetition of the input grid rows three times.\n\n3. The next three rows of the output grid are also a repetition of the input grid rows three times.\n\n4. The last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\nSo, the output grid is essentially the input grid repeated twice vertically, followed by a 3x9 matrix of zeros.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the input grid is repeated three times horizontally and vertically in the output grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the input grid is repeated three times horizontally in the first six rows of the output grid. However, it is only repeated twice vertically, as the last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is [[6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3]], then the output grid would be:\n\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the repeated grids are separated by rows and columns of zeros.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. However, in this particular pattern, the repeated grids are not separated by rows or columns of zeros. Instead, the last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros. This creates a kind of \"padding\" at the bottom of the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: Apply this pattern to the input grid of the quiz.\nA4: A4: Applying the pattern to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ5: Insert rows and columns of zeros between the repeated grids to match the pattern observed in the examples.\nA5: A5: In this particular pattern, we do not insert rows or columns of zeros between the repeated grids. Instead, the last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros. This creates a kind of \"padding\" at the bottom of the output grid. So, the output grid for the quiz would be:\n\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n",
