If the shape is a square or rectangle with a side length of 1 or 2, then the number 8 replaces all the 2s.\nA7: The output grid would be:\n\n[[8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], \n [8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], \n [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], \n [8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8, 0, 8, 2, 2, 8]]"
