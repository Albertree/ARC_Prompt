This can be done by directly assigning the value 8 to the corresponding indices in the grid. \nA5: If the cell is surrounded by 1s and contains a 3, we can iterate over its eight neighboring cells again and change their values to 3. This can be done by directly assigning the value 3 to the corresponding indices in the grid.\nA6: For cells that are not surrounded by 1s, we do not need to do anything. These cells will remain as they are in the output grid. We can ensure this by only modifying the cells that meet the conditions specified in the previous subquestions (i.e., cells that are surrounded by 1s and contain a 4, 6, 8, or 3). All other cells will be left unchanged."

For each cell, we check its eight neighboring cells (top, bottom, left, right, and the four diagonals). If all of these neighboring cells are 1s, then the current cell is surrounded by 1s.\nA2: If the cell is surrounded by 1s and contains a 4, we can iterate over its eight neighboring cells again and change their values to 4.
