For each cell, we apply the rules from Q1 to Q3. If the cell is surrounded by 5s and has a 4 in its immediate neighborhood, we change its value to 2. We continue this process until we have iterated over all cells in the input grid. The resulting grid is the output grid.\n\nSo, the output grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]."
