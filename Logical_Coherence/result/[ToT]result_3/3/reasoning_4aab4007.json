These rows have a section of zeros in the middle, splitting the sequence of numbers into two parts. The number of zeros and their position varies from row to row.\nA3: The pattern of numbers that should replace the zeros is the continuation of the sequence of numbers from the start of the row. The sequence should continue as if the zeros were not there, maintaining the same pattern of numbers.\nA4: Replacing the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers, the output grid should be:\nA5: There are no other changes between the input and output grids. The only difference is the replacement of the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers.\nA6: Applying these changes to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid should be:\n\n[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n[1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n[1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5], \n[1, 1, 4, 2, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7], \n[1, 1, 4, 1, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9], \n[1, 1, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2], \n[1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3], \n[1, 1, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4], \n[1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6], \n[1, 1, 4, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8], \n[1, 1, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9], \n[1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2], \n[1, 1, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4], \n[1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6], \n[1, 1, 4, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8], \n[1, 1, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9], \n[1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2], \n[1, 1, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4], \n[1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6], \n[1, 1, 4, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7], \n[1, 1, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9], \n[1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1], \n[1, 1, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4], \n[1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6], \n[1, 1, 4, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7], \n[1, 1, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]]"
