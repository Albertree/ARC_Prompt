So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the non-zero elements in the input grid and their positions.\nA1: The non-zero elements in the input grid are all 3's and their positions are (1, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 1).\n\n\nQ2: For each non-zero element, create a 3x3 grid where the non-zero element is placed in the same relative position as in the original grid.\nA2: A2: For each non-zero element, the 3x3 grids would be as follows:\n\nFor the 3 at position (1, 0):\n[[0, 0, 0], \n [3, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0]]\n\nFor the 3 at position (1, 1):\n[[0, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 0], \n [0, 0, 0]]\n\nFor the 3 at position (2, 1):\n[[0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 0]]\n\nQ3: Combine these 3x3 grids to form the output grid.\nA3: The output grid would be as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ3: For each 3x3 grid created in Q2, fill the remaining cells with the non-zero element in a pattern that mirrors the original grid.\nA3: A3: The output grid would be as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], \n [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ4: Combine all the 3x3 grids created in Q3 into a single grid by placing them in the same relative positions as in the original grid.\nA4: A4: The final output grid would be as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], \n [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], \n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ5: Replace all the zero elements in the combined grid with the corresponding elements from the original grid.\nA5: A5: The final output grid would be as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0], \n [3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], \n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n",
