                "A1: The pattern of the number 5 in the input grids of the examples is a vertical line of three 5s with a single 5 on either side, one row above and one row below the vertical line. This forms a cross shape.\nA2: The pattern of the number 6 in the input grids of the examples is a horizontal line of three 6s with a single 6 on either side, one column to the left and one column to the right of the horizontal line. This forms a cross shape.\nA3: The pattern of the number 5 in the input grid changes to a horizontal line of three 5s with a single 5 on either side, one column to the left and one column to the right of the horizontal line in the output grid. This forms a cross shape. Essentially, the vertical cross of 5s in the input grid rotates 90 degrees clockwise to form a horizontal cross in the output grid. \nA4: The pattern of the number 6 in the input grid changes to a vertical line of three 6s with a single 6 on either side, one row above and one row below the vertical line in the output grid. This forms a cross shape. Essentially, the horizontal cross of 6s in the input grid rotates 90 degrees clockwise to form a vertical cross in the output grid. \nA5: The pattern of the number 5 in the input grid of the quiz is a vertical line of three 5s with a single 5 on either side, one row above and one row below the vertical line. This forms a cross shape. According to the observed changes from Q3, this pattern should change to a horizontal line of three 5s with a single 5 on either side, one column to the left and one column to the right of the horizontal line in the output grid. \n\nThe pattern of the number 6 in the input grid of the quiz is a horizontal line of three 6s with a single 6 on either side, one column to the left and one column to the right of the horizontal line. This forms a cross shape. According to the observed changes from Q4, this pattern should change to a vertical line of three 6s with a single 6 on either side, one row above and one row below the vertical line in the output grid. \n\nSo, the output grids should be like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
