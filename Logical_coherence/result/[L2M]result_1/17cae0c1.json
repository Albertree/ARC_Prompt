So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.\nA1: The pattern of the input grid is that there are three sections divided by the number 5. The first section is filled with 0s, the second section has a single 5 in the middle row, and the third section is filled with 5s.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of the output grid.\nA2: A2: The pattern of the output grid is that each section of the input grid is replaced with a different number. The first section is replaced with the number 4, the second section is replaced with the number 6, and the third section is replaced with the number 3. The pattern of replacement is consistent across all rows.\n\nQ3: What is the output grid for the quiz?\nA3: The output grid for the quiz would be:\n[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the relationship between the input and output grids.\nA3: A3: The relationship between the input and output grids is that each section of the input grid, divided by the number 5, is replaced with a different number in the output grid. The first section is replaced with the number 4, the second section is replaced with the number 6, and the third section is replaced with the number 3. This pattern of replacement is consistent across all rows.\n\n\nQ4: Determine the rule for assigning the numbers in the output grid based on the position of the 5s in the input grid.\nA4: A4: The rule for assigning the numbers in the output grid based on the position of the 5s in the input grid is as follows: \n\n- The first section before the first occurrence of 5 is replaced with the number 4.\n- The second section between the first and last occurrence of 5 is replaced with the number 6.\n- The third section after the last occurrence of 5 is replaced with the number 3.\n\nThis rule is applied to each row independently.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the rule determined in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the rule determined in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]].\n\n",
