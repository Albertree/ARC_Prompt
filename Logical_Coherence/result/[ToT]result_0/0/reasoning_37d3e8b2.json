                    "A1: In the examples, the color changes follow a pattern where each distinct shape of '8's is changed to a different color. The color is represented by a different number in the output grid. The shapes are not based on their position in the grid, but rather their form and orientation. For example, in the first example, the '8's forming a square are changed to '1', the '8's forming a rectangle are changed to '3', and so on.\nA2: The rules for changing the color of the cells from 8 to another number seem to be based on the distinct shapes formed by the '8's. Each distinct shape or pattern of '8's is assigned a different number, thus changing its color. The assignment of numbers does not seem to follow a specific order and can vary.\nA3: Applying the rules identified in Q2 to the input grid of the quiz, we can see that there are four distinct shapes formed by the '8's. Therefore, we can assign four different numbers to these shapes. The output grid would then look like this:\nA4: In the input grid of the quiz, the cells that are surrounded by '8's are those that are part of the distinct shapes formed by the '8's. These include the cells in the middle of the square and rectangle shapes, as well as the cells that are part of the lines of '8's.\nA5: Applying the color change rules to the cells identified in Q4, we would change the color of these cells based on the shape they are part of. For example, if a cell is part of a square shape, it would be changed to the color assigned to the square shape. Similarly, if a cell is part of a rectangle shape, it would be changed to the color assigned to the rectangle shape. The same rule would apply to the cells that are part of the lines of '8's.\nA6: From the examples, it seems that the color change rules are applied consistently across the entire grid, regardless of the size or orientation of the shapes.
