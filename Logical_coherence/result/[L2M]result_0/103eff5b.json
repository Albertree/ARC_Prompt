grid is that there are groups of numbers (representing different colors) that form specific shapes. In the given example, the number 8 forms a larger shape that resembles a plus sign (+). There are also smaller shapes formed by the numbers 4, 3, and 2. The rest of the grid is filled with 0s.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the changes in the numbers from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA2: A2: The changes from the input grid to the output grid involve the transformation of the larger shape (formed by the number 8) into different smaller shapes, each represented by a different number. The number that each smaller shape is transformed into is determined by the number of the smaller shape that is closest to it in the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the part of the larger shape that is closest to the shape formed by the number 2 is transformed into 2s in the output grid. Similarly, the parts of the larger shape that are closest to the shapes formed by the numbers 1, 3, and 4 are transformed into 1s, 3s, and 4s respectively in the output grid.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the pattern of the numbers in the quiz input grid.\nA3: A3: The pattern in the quiz input grid is similar to the examples. There is a larger shape formed by the number 8, which resembles a plus sign (+). There are also smaller shapes formed by the numbers 4, 3, and 2. The rest of the grid is filled with 0s.\n\n\nQ4: Apply the changes identified in Q2 to the numbers in the quiz input grid identified in Q3.\nA4: A4: Applying the changes identified in Q2 to the quiz input grid, the larger shape formed by the number 8 would be transformed into different smaller shapes, each represented by a different number. The number that each smaller shape is transformed into would be determined by the number of the smaller shape that is closest to it in the input grid. Therefore, the parts of the larger shape that are closest to the shapes formed by the numbers 2, 3, and 4 would be transformed into 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively in the output grid. The rest of the grid would remain filled with 0s.\n\n",
