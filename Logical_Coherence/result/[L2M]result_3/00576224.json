    "prompt": "\nDo you know ARC problem?\n\nIt is similary below.\n\n=========\nExample 1\n\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\n=========\n\nYou can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.\nIn above case, you can inference like below.\n\nIn example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 6], [6, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8], [4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6], [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 9], [4, 3]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3], [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7], [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4], [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 2], [7, 8]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the input grid.\nA1: The pattern in the input grid is a 2x2 grid with different numbers in each cell.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 6x6 grid, three times the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid. The pattern in the output grid is a repetition of the input grid, both horizontally and vertically. The first two rows of the output grid are identical to the input grid, the next two rows are the input grid with the columns swapped, and the last two rows are identical to the input grid again. \n\nQ3: What is the output grid for the quiz?\nA3: The output grid for the quiz would be:\n[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the first two rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's first row, repeated three times.\nA3: A3: Yes, the first two rows of the output grid are indeed repetitions of the input grid's first row, repeated three times. This pattern is also observed in the last two rows of the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the third and fourth rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's second row, but with the elements reversed and repeated three times.\nA4: A4: Yes, the third and fourth rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's second row, but with the elements reversed and repeated three times. This pattern is a key part of the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n\nQ5: Observe that the fifth and sixth rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's first row, repeated three times.\nA5: A5: Yes, the fifth and sixth rows of the output grid are indeed repetitions of the input grid's first row, repeated three times. This pattern is consistent with the first two rows and helps to form the overall pattern in the output grid.\n\n\nQ6: Apply these observations to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA6: A6: Applying these observations to the input grid of the quiz, we can generate the output grid. The input grid is [[3, 2], [7, 8]]. \n\nFollowing the pattern, the output grid would be:\n\n[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], \n [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], \n [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], \n [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], \n [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], \n [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]\n\n",
