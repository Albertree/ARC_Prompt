This can be done using an assignment operation in our code.\nA4: To repeat the process for all colors present in the grid, we can create a loop that iterates through each unique color present in the grid. For each iteration, we perform the steps outlined in the previous subquestions. This ensures that we identify and change the color of all cells that are surrounded by the same color on all four sides, for each color present in the grid.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the quiz.\n\nQuiz Answer:\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids are\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]."
