If two neighbors (either top and bottom or left and right) have the same value as the current cell and the other two neighbors have different values, then the current cell is surrounded by the same number on two sides and different numbers on the other two sides.\nA6: Once we have identified the cells that are surrounded by the same number on two sides and different numbers on the other two sides, we can replace the value of these cells with the number that surrounds them on two sides. This can be done by assigning the value of one of the two neighboring cells (since they both have the same value) to the current cell. \nA7: To identify the cells that are surrounded by the same number on one side and different numbers on the other three sides, we can modify the approach used in Q1, Q3, and Q5. We iterate through each cell in the grid and check its four neighbors. If one neighbor has the same value as the current cell and the other three neighbors have different values, then the current cell is surrounded by the same number on one side and different numbers on the other three sides.\nA8: Once we have identified the cells that are surrounded by the same number on one side and different numbers on the other three sides, we can replace the value of these cells with the number that surrounds them on one side. This can be done by assigning the value of the neighboring cell that has the same value as the current cell. \n\nQ9: Identify the cells that are not surrounded by the same number on any side.\nA9: To identify the cells that are not surrounded by the same number on any side, we can modify the approach used in Q1, Q3, Q5, and Q7. We iterate through each cell in the grid and check its four neighbors. If all four neighbors have different values from the current cell, then the current cell is not surrounded by the same number on any side.\n\nQ10: Replace the identified cells with the number 0.\nA10: Once we have identified the cells that are not surrounded by the same number on any side, we can replace the value of these cells with the number 0. This can be done by simply assigning the value 0 to the current cell. \n\nAfter solving all these subquestions, we can combine the solutions to solve the main problem. We start by identifying and replacing the cells that are surrounded by the same number on all four sides, then move on to the cells that are surrounded by the same number on three sides, and so on, until we have processed all the cells in the grid."
