This pattern is consistent across all examples. \nA4: Yes, the non-zero numbers in the input grid appear in the same relative positions in the output grid, but are repeated three times both horizontally and vertically. This is because the center cell of each 3x3 grid that replaces the original cell in the input grid is the same as the original cell. This pattern is consistent across all examples.\nA5: Applying these patterns to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [4, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
