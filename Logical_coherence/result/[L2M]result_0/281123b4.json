The number 3 always appears in the 5th, 10th, and 15th columns. The numbers 4, 5, 8, and 9 appear in clusters of varying sizes and locations, while the number 0 fills the remaining spaces.\n\n\nQ2: Identify the pattern of the output grid.\nA2: A2: The output grid is a 4x4 grid. The numbers in the output grid are derived from the clusters of numbers in the input grid. The clusters of numbers in the input grid are reduced to a single number in the output grid, which is the number that was clustered. The position of the number in the output grid corresponds to the position of the cluster in the input grid. If there is no cluster in a certain position in the input grid, the corresponding position in the output grid is filled with the number 0.\n\n\nQ3: Identify the most frequent number in each quadrant of the input grid, excluding the number 0.\nA3: A3: The most frequent number in each quadrant of the input grid, excluding the number 0, is as follows:\n\n- Top left quadrant: 8\n- Top right quadrant: 5\n- Bottom left quadrant: 8\n- Bottom right quadrant: 9\n\n\nQ4: Fill in the corresponding quadrant in the output grid with the most frequent number identified in Q3.\nA4: A4: The output grid filled with the most frequent number identified in Q3 is as follows:\n\n[[8, 5], \n [8, 9]]\n\n",
