So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 6], [6, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8], [4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6], [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 9], [4, 3]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3], [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7], [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4], [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 2], [7, 8]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that each row of the input grid is repeated three times in the output grid. The first two repetitions are identical to the input row, and the third repetition is a mirror image of the input row. This pattern is repeated for each row in the input grid.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 6x6 grid, three times the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid. This is because each row of the input grid is repeated three times in the output grid, and each column of the input grid is also repeated three times in the output grid. This results in a 6x6 grid. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is [[3, 2], [7, 8]], then the output grid would be [[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the first two rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's first row, and the second two rows are repetitions of the input grid's second row.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. The first two rows of the output grid are identical to the first row of the input grid, and the third and fourth rows of the output grid are mirror images of the first row of the input grid. Similarly, the fifth and sixth rows of the output grid are identical to the second row of the input grid, and the seventh and eighth rows of the output grid are mirror images of the second row of the input grid. This pattern of repetition and mirroring is consistent across all examples.\n\n\nQ4: Notice that the third and fourth rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's rows but with the elements in each row swapped.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The third and fourth rows of the output grid are indeed repetitions of the input grid's rows, but with the elements in each row swapped. This creates a mirror image effect. Similarly, the seventh and eighth rows of the output grid are mirror images of the second row of the input grid. This pattern of repetition and mirroring is consistent across all examples.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the same pattern to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the same pattern to the input grid of the quiz, which is [[3, 2], [7, 8]], we get the output grid as [[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].\n\n",
