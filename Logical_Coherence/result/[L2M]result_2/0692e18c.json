The input grid is expanded to three times its original size in both dimensions (rows and columns). The original grid is replicated in a 3x3 pattern in the expanded grid.\n\n2. The values in the expanded grid are then rearranged according to the following rules:\n   - The values in the top left quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the top right quadrant of the original grid.\n   - The values in the top right quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the bottom right quadrant of the original grid.\n   - The values in the bottom left quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the top left quadrant of the original grid.\n   - The values in the bottom right quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the bottom left quadrant of the original grid.\n\n3. The values in the middle row and middle column of the expanded grid are set to 0.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 9x9 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 9x9 grid, which is three times the size of the input 3x3 grid. This is part of the transformation pattern identified in the examples.\n\nQuiz Answer:\nIf the input grid is \n[[0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0]],\nthen the output grid would be\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the input grid is replicated in a 3x3 pattern to form the output grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, the input grid is indeed replicated in a 3x3 pattern to form the output grid. However, the values are rearranged according to the rules identified in the pattern. This includes moving values from one quadrant to another and setting the values in the middle row and middle column to 0. This transformation pattern is consistent across all the examples provided.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the transformation of the individual cells in the input grid to their corresponding 3x3 blocks in the output grid.\nA4: A4: The transformation of the individual cells in the input grid to their corresponding 3x3 blocks in the output grid is as follows:\n\n- The cell in the top left corner of the input grid is transformed into the bottom left 3x3 block in the output grid.\n- The cell in the top right corner of the input grid is transformed into the top left 3x3 block in the output grid.\n- The cell in the bottom left corner of the input grid is transformed into the bottom right 3x3 block in the output grid.\n- The cell in the bottom right corner of the input grid is transformed into the top right 3x3 block in the output grid.\n- The cells in the middle row and middle column of the input grid are transformed into the middle row and middle column of the output grid, but all their values are set to 0.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the transformation rules identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the transformation rules identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n",
