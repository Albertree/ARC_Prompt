For example, if the color of the surrounding cells is represented by the number 2, we can represent a different shade of the same color by the number 6.\nA4: To repeat the process for all colors present in the grid, we can iterate through each unique color present in the grid. For each color, we perform the steps outlined in the previous subquestions. This can be done by creating a list of unique colors present in the grid, and then looping through this list. For each color in the list, we identify the cells that are surrounded by that color on all four sides, determine the color of the surrounding cells, and then change the color of the identified cells to a different shade of the surrounding color. \n\nAfter performing these steps for all colors in the grid, we will have the final output grid. \n\nThe output grids for the quiz would be:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 1, 6, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]"
