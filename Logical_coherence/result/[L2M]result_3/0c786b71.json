So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[6, 2, 4, 2], [2, 2, 6, 6], [6, 4, 2, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4], [6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6], [2, 4, 2, 6, 6, 2, 4, 2], [2, 4, 2, 6, 6, 2, 4, 2], [6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6], [4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 5, 5, 5], [5, 7, 5, 7]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 7], [5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5], [9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5], [7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 7]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 3, 5, 5], [5, 8, 5, 8], [8, 8, 5, 8]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8], [8, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 8], [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5], [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5], [8, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 8], [8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 5, 7, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8, 5]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: The pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid is that each row of the input grid is mirrored and then appended to itself. The entire grid is then mirrored vertically. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first row of the input grid [6, 2, 4, 2] is mirrored to become [2, 4, 2, 6] and then appended to itself to become [4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4]. This is done for each row. The entire grid is then mirrored vertically to get the final output. \n\nThis pattern is consistent across all the examples.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that each row of the input grid is mirrored and then appended to itself. After this, the entire grid is mirrored vertically to get the final output.\n\nQuiz Answer:\nIf the input grid is \n[[8, 5, 7, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8, 5]],\nthen the output grid will be\n[[5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5]].\n\n\nQ3: Apply the same transformation to the quiz input grid by mirroring it horizontally and vertically.\nA3: A3: If we apply the same transformation to the quiz input grid by mirroring it horizontally and vertically, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5]].\n\n",
