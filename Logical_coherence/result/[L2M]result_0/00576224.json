    "prompt": "\nDo you know ARC problem?\n\nIt is similary below.\n\n=========\nExample 1\n\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\n=========\n\nYou can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.\nIn above case, you can inference like below.\n\nIn example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[8, 6], [6, 4]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8], [4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6], [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 9], [4, 3]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3], [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7], [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4], [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 2], [7, 8]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the input grid.\nA1: A1: The pattern in the input grid is a 2x2 matrix with different numbers. Each row of the matrix is repeated three times to form a 6x6 matrix. The numbers in the rows are also repeated three times. The pattern also alternates between the original row and its reverse.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a 6x6 grid. The pattern in the output grid is that each row from the input grid is repeated three times horizontally and then alternated vertically with its reverse. This pattern is repeated three times to form the 6x6 grid.\n\nQ3: What is the output grid for the quiz?\nA3: The output grid for the quiz would be:\n[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the first two rows of the output grid are the same as the input grid, repeated three times horizontally.\nA3: A3: Yes, the first two rows of the output grid are indeed the same as the input grid, repeated three times horizontally. This pattern is then alternated with the reverse of the original rows.\n\n\nQ4: The next two rows are the transposed version of the input grid, repeated three times horizontally.\nA4: A4: Yes, the next two rows are the reversed version of the input grid, repeated three times horizontally. This pattern is then alternated with the original rows.\n\n\nQ5: The last two rows are the same as the first two rows of the output grid.\nA5: A5: Yes, the last two rows of the output grid are indeed the same as the first two rows. This completes the pattern of alternating between the original rows and their reversed versions, each repeated three times horizontally.\n\n\nQ6: Apply this pattern to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA6: A6: Applying this pattern to the input grid of the quiz, which is [[3, 2], [7, 8]], we get the output grid as [[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].\n\n",
