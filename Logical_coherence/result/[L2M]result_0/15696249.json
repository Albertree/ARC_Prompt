The input grid is a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n2. The first three rows of the output grid are a repetition of the input grid's rows three times.\n3. The next three rows of the output grid are also a repetition of the input grid's rows three times.\n4. The last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\nIn other words, the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid twice vertically, and three times horizontally, and then filling the last three rows with zeros.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the input grid is repeated three times horizontally in the output grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the input grid is indeed repeated three times horizontally in the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided. The rows of the input grid are copied and pasted three times in a row to form the corresponding rows in the output grid. This pattern is repeated for the first two sets of three rows in the output grid. The last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is [[6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3]], then the output grid would be:\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the output grid is a 9x9 grid, with the input grid repeated three times in the first three rows, and the rest of the rows filled with zeros.\nA3: A3: Yes, that's correct. The output grid is a 9x9 grid. The first three rows of the output grid are a repetition of the input grid's rows three times. The next three rows of the output grid are also a repetition of the input grid's rows three times. The last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros. This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided.\n\n\nQ4: Apply this pattern to the quiz input grid.\nA4: A4: Applying the identified pattern to the quiz input grid [[6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3]], we get the output grid as follows:\n\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n",
