It is located at the 6th and 7th columns of the first three rows, with a gap at the 2nd row, 7th column.\n\n\nQ4: Determine the pattern of the number 4 in the input grid.\nA4: A4: The pattern of the number 4 in the input grid is that it is located at the first column of the 5th row and the fourth column of the 8th row. There is no specific pattern between these two positions.\n\n\nQ5: Based on the pattern of the number 8 and the location of the number 4, determine the transformation rule to apply to the input grid.\nA5: A5: The transformation rule seems to be that the pattern of the number 8 is mirrored horizontally and vertically around the position of the number 4.
