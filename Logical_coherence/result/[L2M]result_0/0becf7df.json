So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve.

number 4\n\nThese cells are not surrounded by the same number on all sides because they either have different numbers surrounding them or they are on the edge of the grid.\n\n\nQ4: Replace the number in the identified cells with the number that is most common among the surrounding cells.\nA4: A4: The cells identified in Q3 cannot be replaced with the number that is most common among the surrounding cells, as they are either on the edge of the grid or surrounded by different numbers. The rule of replacing the number in the cell with the most common number among the surrounding cells only applies to the cells that are fully surrounded by other cells.\n\n\nQ5: If there is a tie for the most common number among the surrounding cells, replace the number in the identified cells with the number that is in the same row or column and closest to the identified cell.\nA5: A5: The rule of replacing the number in the identified cells with the number that is in the same row or column and closest to the identified cell only applies when there is a tie for the most common number among the surrounding cells. However, in the given input grid, there are no such cases where there is a tie for the most common number among the surrounding cells. Therefore, no changes will be made based on this rule.\n\n",
