Regardless of the row, the 6th and 7th columns from the left and the 14th and 15th columns from the left are replaced with zeros.\nA4: Applying this pattern to the input grid of the quiz, the output grid would be:\n\n[[4, 5, 7, 5, 9, 0, 0, 1, 7, 8, 6, 9, 4, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 7], [9, 1, 7, 5, 5, 0, 0, 7, 1, 9, 1, 7, 4, 8, 0, 0, 2, 9, 5, 8], [9, 1, 8, 6, 9, 0, 0, 6, 9, 5, 5, 5, 8, 1, 0, 0, 4, 7, 8, 5], [4, 2, 9, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 9, 6, 1, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2, 3, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 3, 5, 0, 0, 2, 6, 4, 6], [1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 6], [7, 7, 1, 9, 2, 0, 0, 9, 1, 5, 5, 8, 5, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 1, 2], [2, 9, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 7, 6, 4, 1, 8, 5, 0, 0, 2, 4, 7, 7], [4, 2, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5, 8, 6, 3, 0, 0, 8, 4, 7, 4], [3, 2, 4, 8, 9, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 8, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 9, 1, 8, 5], [1, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 3, 9, 3, 2, 2, 6, 7, 0, 0, 9, 8, 5, 7], [1, 6, 4, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 7, 3, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 6], [8, 6, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 9, 6, 9, 4, 9, 7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 9, 3], [3, 7, 7, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 8, 2, 5, 8, 0, 0, 6, 7, 6, 7], [6, 9, 5, 6, 3, 0, 0, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8, 5, 3, 0, 0, 8, 9, 5, 4], [2, 8, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0, 7, 9, 8, 9, 5, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 5, 8, 4], [7, 8, 4, 7, 9, 0, 0, 7, 9, 8, 5, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 1, 2], [4, 5, 9, 9, 4, 0, 0, 5, 9, 8, 5, 8, 7, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 1, 2], [1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 7, 5, 8, 7, 0, 0, 6, 1, 7, 7], [2, 9, 2, 6, 7, 0, 0, 5, 3, 2, 2, 5, 8, 1, 0, 0, 4, 6, 7, 3]]"
