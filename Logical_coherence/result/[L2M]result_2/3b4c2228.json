So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 2], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 5\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [3, 0, 2, 2, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the locations of the 3s in the input grid.\nA1: A1: The locations of the 3s in the input grid are at the following coordinates: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (5,0), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1).\n\n\nQ2: Identify the locations of the 2s in the input grid.\nA2: A2: The locations of the 2s in the input grid are at the following coordinates: (3,0), (6,3), (6,4), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n\nQ3: Determine the number of 3s and 2s in the input grid.\nA3: A3: The number of 3s in the input grid is 9 and the number of 2s is 5.\n\n\nQ4: Create a 3x3 output grid.\nA4: A4: The output grid would be [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]].\n\n\nQ5: If there are more 3s than 2s, place a 1 in the top left corner of the output grid.\nA5: A5: Yes, there are more 3s than 2s in the input grid. So, we place a 1 in the top left corner of the output grid.\n\n\nQ6: If there are 3s in the top half of the input grid, place a 1 in the middle of the output grid.\nA6: A6: No, there are no 3s in the top half of the input grid. So, we do not place a 1 in the middle of the output grid.\n\n\nQ7: If there are 2s in the bottom half of the input grid, place a 1 in the middle of the output grid.\nA7: A7: Yes, there are 2s in the bottom half of the input grid. So, we place a 1 in the bottom right corner of the output grid.\n\n\nQ8: Fill the rest of the output grid with 0s.\nA8: A8: Yes, the rest of the output grid is filled with 0s. So, the final output grid is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]].\n\n",
