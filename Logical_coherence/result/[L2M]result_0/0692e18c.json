The input grid is expanded to three times its original size in both dimensions (rows and columns). The original grid is replicated in a 3x3 pattern in the expanded grid.\n\n2. The values in the expanded grid are then rearranged according to the following rules:\n   - The values in the top left quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the top right quadrant of the original grid.\n   - The values in the top right quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the bottom right quadrant of the original grid.\n   - The values in the bottom left quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the top left quadrant of the original grid.\n   - The values in the bottom right quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the bottom left quadrant of the original grid.\n\n3. The values in the middle row and middle column of the expanded grid are set to 0.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a 9x9 grid, three times the size of the input grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 9x9 grid, which is three times the size of the input 3x3 grid. This is part of the transformation pattern identified in the examples.\n\nQuiz Answer:\nIf the input grid is \n[[0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0]],\nthen the output grid would be\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the input grid is divided into 9 3x3 grids in the output grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, the output grid is indeed divided into 9 3x3 grids, each of which is a copy of the original input grid. However, the values in these 3x3 grids are rearranged according to the pattern identified in the examples.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the transformation of each cell in the input grid to a 3x3 grid in the output grid.\nA4: A4: Each cell in the input grid is transformed into a 3x3 grid in the output grid as follows:\n\n- The top left cell of the input grid is transformed into the bottom left 3x3 grid in the output grid.\n- The top middle cell of the input grid is transformed into the top middle 3x3 grid in the output grid.\n- The top right cell of the input grid is transformed into the top left 3x3 grid in the output grid.\n- The middle left cell of the input grid is transformed into the middle middle 3x3 grid in the output grid.\n- The middle cell of the input grid is transformed into the middle left, middle right, top middle, and bottom middle 3x3 grids in the output grid.\n- The middle right cell of the input grid is transformed into the middle middle 3x3 grid in the output grid.\n- The bottom left cell of the input grid is transformed into the top left 3x3 grid in the output grid.\n- The bottom middle cell of the input grid is transformed into the bottom middle 3x3 grid in the output grid.\n- The bottom right cell of the input grid is transformed into the bottom right 3x3 grid in the output grid.\n\nIn each 3x3 grid in the output, the value from the corresponding cell in the input grid is placed in the same relative position, except for the middle cell, which is always set to 0.\n\n\nQ5: Apply the transformation rules identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz.\nA5: A5: Applying the transformation rules identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n",
