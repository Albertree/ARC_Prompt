Then, a vertically flipped version of the resulting grid is appended below. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input grid is:\n\n[[6, 2, 4, 2], \n [2, 2, 6, 6], \n [6, 4, 2, 4]]\n\nThe horizontally mirrored version of this grid is:\n\n[[2, 4, 2, 6], \n [6, 6, 2, 2], \n [4, 2, 4, 6]]\n\nAppending this to the right of the original input grid gives:\n\n[[6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6], \n [2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2], \n [6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6]]\n\nThe vertically mirrored version of this grid is:\n\n[[6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6], \n [2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2], \n [6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6]]\n\nAppending this below the previous grid gives the final output grid:\n\n[[6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6], \n [2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2], \n [6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6], \n [6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6], \n [2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2], \n [6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6]]\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the values in the input grid are reflected along the central vertical and horizontal axes to form the output grid.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is:\n[[8, 5, 7, 8], \n [7, 7, 8, 8], \n [5, 5, 8, 5]]\n\nThen the output grid, following the pattern identified, would be:\n\n[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]\n\n\nQ3: Apply the same transformation to the quiz input grid.\nA3: A3: If we apply the same transformation to the quiz input grid:\n\n[[8, 5, 7, 8], \n [7, 7, 8, 8], \n [5, 5, 8, 5]]\n\nFirst, we mirror the grid horizontally:\n\n[[8, 7, 5, 8], \n [8, 8, 7, 7], \n [5, 8, 5, 5]]\n\nThen, we append this to the right of the original input grid:\n\n[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5]]\n\nNext, we mirror the resulting grid vertically:\n\n[[5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]\n\nFinally, we append this below the previous grid to get the final output grid:\n\n[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]\n\n\nQ4: Mirror the input grid horizontally and vertically to generate the output grid.\nA4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves mirroring the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the values in the input grid are reflected along the central vertical and horizontal axes to form the output grid. \n\nFor the quiz input grid:\n\n[[8, 5, 7, 8], \n [7, 7, 8, 8], \n [5, 5, 8, 5]]\n\nThe horizontally mirrored version of this grid is:\n\n[[8, 7, 5, 8], \n [8, 8, 7, 7], \n [5, 8, 5, 5]]\n\nAppending this to the right of the original input grid gives:\n\n[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5]]\n\nThe vertically mirrored version of this grid is:\n\n[[5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]\n\nAppending this below the previous grid gives the final output grid:\n\n[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], \n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], \n [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]\n\n",
