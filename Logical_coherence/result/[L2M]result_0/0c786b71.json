This means that the rows and columns of the input grid are duplicated in reverse order. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first row of the input grid is [6, 2, 4, 2]. In the output grid, this row is mirrored to become [4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4]. The same process is applied to all rows and columns of the input grid to form the output grid.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the elements of each row and column in the input grid are duplicated in reverse order to form the output grid. \n\nFor example, in the input grid row [8, 5, 7, 8], the mirrored version would be [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8]. This process is applied to all rows and columns to form the output grid.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is [[8, 5, 7, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8, 5]], then the output grid would be [[5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5]].\n\n\nQ3: Implement a function that mirrors the input grid horizontally.\nA3: A3: Here is a Python function that mirrors a 2D list (grid) horizontally:\n\n```python\ndef mirror_grid_horizontally(grid):\n    return [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to create a new list where each row is the reverse of the corresponding row in the original grid. The `[::-1]` slice operation is used to reverse the order of elements in each row.\n\n\nQ4: Implement a function that mirrors the input grid vertically.\nA4: A4: Here is a Python function that mirrors a 2D list (grid) vertically:\n\n```python\ndef mirror_grid_vertically(grid):\n    return grid[::-1]\n```\n\nThis function uses the `[::-1]` slice operation to reverse the order of the rows in the grid, effectively mirroring the grid vertically.\n\n\nQ5: Combine the two functions to create the final output grid.\nA5: A5: Here is a Python function that combines the two previous functions to create the final output grid:\n\n```python\ndef mirror_grid(grid):\n    # Mirror the grid horizontally\n    horizontal_mirror = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Mirror the grid vertically\n    vertical_mirror = horizontal_mirror[::-1]\n    \n    # Combine the two mirrors\n    output_grid = []\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        output_grid.append(grid[i] + horizontal_mirror[i])\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        output_grid.append(vertical_mirror[i])\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThis function first mirrors the input grid horizontally and vertically, and then combines the two mirrored grids to create the final output grid. The output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\n\n",
    "answer": "A5: Here is a Python function that combines the two previous functions to create the final output grid:\n\n```python\ndef mirror_grid(grid):\n    # Mirror the grid horizontally\n    horizontal_mirror = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Mirror the grid vertically\n    vertical_mirror = horizontal_mirror[::-1]\n    \n    # Combine the two mirrors\n    output_grid = []\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        output_grid.append(grid[i] + horizontal_mirror[i])\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        output_grid.append(vertical_mirror[i])\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThis function first mirrors the input grid horizontally and vertically, and then combines the two mirrored grids to create the final output grid.
