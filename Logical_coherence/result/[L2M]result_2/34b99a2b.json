The output grid is a 4x5 grid where each cell represents the count of the number 8 in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. \n\nFor example, in the first row of the first example, there are two 8's in the row and two 8's in the column, so the first cell of the output grid is 2. In the second row, there are three 8's in the row and two 8's in the column, so the second cell of the output grid is 2. This pattern continues for the rest of the grid. \n\nThe same pattern applies to the other examples as well. The output grid is always a 4x5 grid, and each cell represents the count of the number 8 in the corresponding row and column of the input grid.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is always 4 columns wide.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always 4 columns wide. This is because the transformation pattern involves counting the number of 8's in each row and column of the input grid, and the input grid always has 4 columns that contain the number 8. Therefore, the output grid will always have 4 columns, regardless of the size or shape of the input grid.\n\n\nQ3: Observe that the values in the output grid are determined by the values in the input grid.\nA3: A3: Yes, the values in the output grid are directly determined by the values in the input grid. Specifically, each value in the output grid represents the count of the number 8 in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. This means that the values in the output grid are directly dependent on the distribution and frequency of the number 8 in the input grid. \n\nFor example, if a row or column in the input grid has no 8's, the corresponding cell in the output grid will be 0. If a row or column in the input grid has one 8, the corresponding cell in the output grid will be 1, and so on. This pattern applies to all cells in the output grid, and is consistent across all examples. \n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]],\n\nthen the output grid will be \n[[0, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [0, 2, 2, 2]].\n\n\nQ4: Determine the rule for transforming the values.\nA4: A4: The rule for transforming the values from the input grid to the output grid is as follows:\n\n1. For each cell in the output grid, count the number of 8's in the corresponding row and column in the input grid.\n2. The value of the cell in the output grid is the minimum of the count of 8's in the corresponding row and column in the input grid.\n3. Repeat this process for all cells in the output grid.\n\nThis rule is consistent across all examples and will always result in a 4x5 output grid, regardless of the size or shape of the input grid.\n\n\nQ5: Apply these observations to transform the input grid of the quiz into the output grid.\nA5: A5: Applying the observations and rules identified above, we can transform the input grid of the quiz into the output grid as follows:\n\nInput grid:\n[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]]\n\nCount the number of 8's in each row and column:\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [0, 2, 2, 2]]\n\nSo, the output grid is:\n[[0, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [2, 2, 2, 2], \n [0, 2, 2, 2]]\n\n",
