The height of the output grid is the number of rows that contain the number 8, and the width of the output grid is three times the width of the shape formed by the number 8, because the number 4 is in the middle of the grid, indicating that the shape should be repeated three times horizontally.\nA6: The output grid filled with the number 8 according to the pattern identified in Q4 is as follows:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]]"
