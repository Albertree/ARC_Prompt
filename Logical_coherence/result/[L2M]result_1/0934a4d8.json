So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[3, 1, 1, 9, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 3,

in the input grids is that the center 4x4 grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The rest of the grid remains the same.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grids are always 4x7.\nA2: A2: Yes, the output grids are always 4x7. This is because the center 4x4 grid of the input is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then placed in the center of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the remaining elements from the input grid.\n\n\nQ3: Notice that the output grids are always located in the center of the input grids.\nA3: A3: Yes, the output grids are always located in the center of the input grids.

The rest of the output grid is filled with the remaining elements from the input grid.\n\n\nQ4: Identify the exact location of the output grids in the input grids.\nA4: A4: The output grids are derived from the center 4x4 grid of the input grids. Specifically, the output grids are formed by rotating the 4x4 grid located in the 14th to 17th rows and 14th to 17th columns of the input grids 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n\nQ5: Extract the output grids from the input grids.\nA5: A5: To extract the output grids from the input grids, you would need to identify the center 4x4 grid in the input, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, and then place it in the center of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the remaining elements from the input grid. \n\nFor example, in the given quiz input, the center 4x4 grid is:\n\n[[9, 7, 7, 4],\n [7, 4, 9, 7],\n [7, 9, 4, 7],\n [9, 7, 7, 4]]\n\nRotating this 90 degrees clockwise gives:\n\n[[9, 7, 7, 9],\n [7, 9, 4, 7],\n [7, 4, 9, 7],\n [4, 7, 7, 4]]\n\nThis rotated grid is then placed in the center of the output grid, and the remaining elements from the input grid are used to fill in the rest of the output grid.\n\n",
