So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1], [0, 7, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 5, 1, 7, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 8, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0], [3, 3, 3, 7, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 0, 8, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 0, 8, 8]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[1, 7, 7, 1, 0, 8, 0, 5], [1, 7, 7, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [5, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 7, 7, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3], [3, 7, 7, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1]].\n\nExample 4\nIf input grids are like that\n[[1, 0, 5], [1, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[3, 0, 3], [3, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 5, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 5], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1], [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 7]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the cells in the grid that are surrounded by 1s on all four sides.\nA1: A1: The cells that are surrounded by 1s on all four sides are:\n\n- (1, 1)\n- (1, 6)\n- (3, 1)\n- (3, 5)\n- (4, 1)\n- (4, 5)\n- (6, 2)\n- (6, 6)\n- (7, 2)\n- (7, 5)\n\nQ2: What is the rule for transforming the input grid into the output grid?\n\nA2: The rule for transforming the input grid into the output grid is to change the value of the cells that are surrounded by 1s on all four sides to 3. \n\nQ3: What is the output grid?\n\nA3: The output grid is:\n\n[[0, 5, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0], \n [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n [1, 3, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 0, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1], \n [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7], \n [1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7], \n [0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3, 0, 7]]\n\n\nQ2: Change the value of these identified cells to 3.\nA2: A2: Yes, the rule for transforming the input grid into the output grid is to change the value of the cells that are surrounded by 1s on all four sides to 3.\n\n",
