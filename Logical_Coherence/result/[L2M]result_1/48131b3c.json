    "prompt": "\nDo you know ARC problem?\n\nIt is similary below.\n\n=========\nExample 1\n\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\n=========\n\nYou can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.\nIn above case, you can inference like below.\n\nIn example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,\n[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen you can move object to right side.\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].\n\nLike this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.\n\nBelow problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.\n\n=========\n\nExample 1\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]].\n\nExample 2\nIf input grids are like that\n[[7, 0], [0, 7]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0]].\n\nExample 3\nIf input grids are like that\n[[4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]],\nthen this grids change to output grids below\n[[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4]].\n\nQuiz\nIf input grids are like that\n[[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen output grids?\n\n=========\nQ1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.\nA1: A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that each row and column of the input grid is duplicated in the output grid. This results in an output grid that is twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions. The values in the cells of the output grid are the same as the corresponding cells in the input grid.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the output grid is a larger version of the input grid, with each cell in the input grid being represented by a 2x2 square in the output grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, that's correct. Each cell in the input grid is represented by a 2x2 square in the output grid. This means that the output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\n\nQuiz Answer: \nIf the input grid is \n[[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]],\nthen the output grid will be\n[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\n\nQ3: Identify the rule for transforming a single cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid.\nA3: A3: The rule for transforming a single cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid is to simply duplicate the value of the cell in the input grid four times. This results in a 2x2 square in the output grid where all four cells have the same value as the original cell in the input grid.\n\n\nQ4: Apply this rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.\nA4: A4: Applying the rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:\n\n[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], \n [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], \n [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], \n [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].\n\nEach cell in the input grid has been transformed into a 2x2 square in the output grid with the same value.\n\n",
