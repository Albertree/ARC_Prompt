                "A1: The row that contains all 1s in the input grid is the 9th row.\nA2: The pattern of 2s and 8s above the row of 1s in the input grid is a symmetrical pattern. The 2s are located at the 4th and 7th positions from the left in the 4th and 6th rows above the row of 1s. The 8s are located at the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th positions from the left in the 5th row above the row of 1s. The 8s are also located at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th positions from the left in the 7th row above the row of 1s. There are no 2s or 8s below the row of 1s in the input grid.\nA3: Since there are no 2s or 8s below the row of 1s in the input grid, we will replicate the pattern of 2s and 8s from above the row of 1s to below the row of 1s. The 2s will be located at the 4th and 7th positions from the left in the 4th and 6th rows below the row of 1s. The 8s will be located at the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th positions from the left in the 5th row below the row of 1s. The 8s will also be located at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th positions from the left in the 7th row below the row of 1s.\nA4: After swapping the pattern, we will replace the 2s with 3s and the 8s with 4s. The 3s will be located at the 4th and 7th positions from the left in the 4th and 6th rows below the row of 1s. The 4s will be located at the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th positions from the left in the 5th row below the row of 1s. The 4s will also be located at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th positions from the left in the 7th row below the row of 1s.\n\nSo, the output grids are like that\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]."
