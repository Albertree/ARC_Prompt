If the number of cells in the horizontal direction is equal to the number of cells in the vertical direction, then the identified cell is part of a square of '3's. If not, it is part of a rectangle of '3's.\nA3: To replace the outermost layer of '3's with '4's and the next layer with '2's, we can iterate over the cells in the square or rectangle identified in Q2. If a cell is on the edge (i.e., it has at least one neighbor that is not '3'), we replace it with '4'. Then, we iterate over the cells again and replace any remaining '3's that are adjacent to '4's with '2's.\nA4: If the identified cells are not part of a larger square or rectangle, we can simply iterate over these cells and replace the '3's with '4's. This can be done by checking if the cell is not part of a square or rectangle (as determined in Q2) and then replacing the value.\n\nThe output grids for the quiz would be:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
