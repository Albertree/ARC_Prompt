The input grid is a 3x3 matrix. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. The input grid is replicated three times in the output grid - once at the top left, once in the middle, and once at the bottom right.\n\n3. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s. \n\nThis pattern is consistent across all the examples.\n\n\nQ2: Notice that the input grid is replicated and placed in different positions in the output grid.\nA2: A2: Yes, the input grid is replicated and placed in three different positions in the output grid. The first replication is placed at the top left corner of the output grid, the second replication is placed in the middle of the output grid, and the third replication is placed at the bottom right corner of the output grid. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with 0s.\n\nQuiz Answer:\nIf the input grid is \n[[9, 7, 9], [9, 9, 7], [7, 9, 7]],\nthen the output grid would be\n[[9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7]].\n\n\nQ3: Determine the positions where the input grid is placed in the output grid.\nA3: A3: The input grid is placed in three positions in the output grid:\n\n1. The top left corner of the output grid. This is the first 3x3 block in the output grid.\n\n2. The center of the output grid. This is the 3x3 block starting from the 4th row and 4th column in the output grid.\n\n3. The bottom right corner of the output grid. This is the last 3x3 block in the output grid.\n\n\nQ4: Create a 9x9 grid filled with zeros.\nA4: A4: Here is a 9x9 grid filled with zeros:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\nQ5: Place the input grid in the positions determined in Q3 on the 9x9 grid.\nA5: A5: To place the input grid in the positions determined in Q3 on the 9x9 grid, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. For the top left corner, replace the first 3x3 block in the 9x9 grid with the input grid.\n\n2. For the center, replace the 3x3 block starting from the 4th row and 4th column in the 9x9 grid with the input grid.\n\n3. For the bottom right corner, replace the last 3x3 block in the 9x9 grid with the input grid.\n\nSo, if the input grid is [[9, 7, 9], [9, 9, 7], [7, 9, 7]], the 9x9 grid after placing the input grid in the determined positions would be:\n\n[[9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7]]\n\n\nQ6: The resulting grid from Q5 is the output grid.\nA6: A6: Yes, the resulting grid from Q5 is indeed the output grid. The transformation of the input grid to the output grid involves replicating the input grid and placing it in three specific positions in the output grid, while the rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s. This pattern is consistent across all the examples and can be applied to any 3x3 input grid to generate the corresponding 9x9 output grid.\n\n",
